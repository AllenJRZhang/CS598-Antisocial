(Example if reddit would try to suppress a political direction,... oh wait they did).

Under that assumption, there would really be no conspiracy to \"allow\" anti-Trump subs to appear. In fact, that would serve to explain why new ones keep being made (to game the history system).\\n\\n> It\\'s okay for altright to get banned but fuckthealtright somehow is just fine.\\n\\nI don\\'t know exactly what goes on in fuckthealtright, but it seems pretty likely that they aren\\'t guilty of the same crimes that altright was.

There\\'s literally no legal reason for them to allow any speech they don\\'t like - they\\'re not bound by the constitution at all, in that regard. And even so, they still stand up for it, to really impressive extents! If you think that banning altright is so unconscionable that it means those ideals are irrevocably compromised, let me tell you something - *not even the constitutional implementation of Free Speech is absolute*. [Schenck v. United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenck_v._United_States) established that the right to free speech cannot supersede people\\'s safety, and that legitimately dangerous speech can be prevented by law.\\n\\nNow, I\\'ll reiterate that reddit *is not bound by this*. They have no obligation to uphold the constitution version of Free Speech in the first place, and insofar as they *choose* to do so anyway, they are well within their rights to alter it with whatever additional boundaries that they want. But considering what altright was actually *doing* to earn their ban - organizing to find, harass, and possibly even cause violence to, a specific person - it seems to me like reddit was playing pretty close to the spirit of the constitutional limits on Free Speech anyway.

If you slightly support Trump, you are being name called and you aren't taken serious. And thus Trump supporters take you serious and won't insult you. Forcing you to be even a more Trump supporter. And if you dislike Trump, the people around you push you more and more to see him as the most evil thing out there. \\n\\nPersonally I think this does favor in the direction of Trump. Since anti-trump side is becoming less and less relatable, and if you talk about this, you will be ridiculed and then you get the original issue again. So it doesn't only destroy the shades of thinking to force 2 options, but it also destroys the balance, putting way more on 1 side.

Both sides are at fault. Though Trump does it in another way, he uses his position/persuasion/twitter and patriotism, to force less shades. Now as a reaction the other side does the same, and they indeed gain more traction and support, but I think Trump gains way more. Trump's gains aren't the loudest, but the quiet. \\n\\nSo this actually might be all Trumps doing (on purpose or completely by accident), he lays a hook and bait.

A child\\'s survival has traditionally meant 15-20 years of investment in their well-being and education. Since it requires such a large investment of time and energy, males who decided to participate in those activities likely increased the likely hood of their offsprings survival. Having large numbers of children with the same female has the added benefit of allowing a male to continue a sexual, offspring bearing relationship with less overall effort. Where as a male who used that time to run off to find multiple mates not only has to spend energy initiating each relationship, but then moves on and does nothing to improve his offsprings chances of survival.

He won a large amount of swing states that pretty up much to election night weren't event considered a possibility. Remember going into election night he had like a 2% chance of winning? Then all of a sudden a few hours later he was guanateed the win if he took Michigan? And then he took Michigan? This is how polls can be so deceiving. So to that end i ask, all these approval rating polls, where were they conducted? The same places that told us he had a 2% chance of winning? Or the places that actually got him the win?\\n\\nLook i WANT Democrats to show up and vote next time. I want Republicans to show up as well. It's stupid that like 30% of eligible voters are all that came out to vote. I voted trump, with some apprehension. And there are a lot of really good criticisms of him out there. But the extreme unfounded criticism that is the same language shouted over and over again isn't good criticism. It numbs people to the real problems with his administration. Calling trump a homophobe? He is by FAR the most pro LGBT Republican ever. He waved a rainbow flag at a rally for the love of God. What has he actually done that makes him a homophobe? To that extent, it's the same with people that are calling Milo (for all his many, many faults) a racist homophobe.

If you watched any election coverage you would think they asked every single American who they were going to vote for and unequivocally 98% said Hillary.  It doesn\\'t matter if maybe one poll out there got it right, that poll didn\\'t get traction. Which was my point. Polls don\\'t matter.

You people never get bored of making these. \\n\\nI see a lot of people complaining about how this is hitting the top of /all and now they have to filter it, but I think the filter system is part of the problem. Everyone is filtering these anti Trump subs except for the people who upvote them. So there is no only left to downvote them and they explode and get tons of upvotes with no one voting them all down. This leads to them taking over the front page all the time. , can you idiots stop ruining the front page and making new subreddits every fucking week. I\\'m struggling to filter you morons out. , Stay salty, leftists 😄 , I find it hilarious that people are saying how awful she is for \"making up\" an attack. Do you remember all the psycho lefties who actually DID make up attacks right after Donald won? The girl who claimed her Hajib was ripped off her head by a bunch of white boys screaming \"this is Trumps America now - go back to where you came from!\" for instance? Remember that? And remember how we found out later that she completely lied about it? Because she was afraid of her dad finding out she had been out drinking? And remember all the swastikas that were actually drawn by crazy leftists who claimed they were drawn by Trump supporters? And remember the guy who said his mother died overseas because she wasn\\'t allowed back in to the country due to the EO? And remember how he flat out lied? And she really died days before the EO even happened?\\nYeah. Let\\'s stop being the biggest hypocritical nut jobs around, lefties. It\\'s not a good look. \\nP.s. You\\'re twenty times worse than the Donald (which is EXACTLY what it says it is - a Trump fan club if you will) because you\\'re just a bunch of unoriginal babies who create 20,000 subreddits about the same damn thing because you can\\'t handle it when people say things you don\\'t like.

Make fun of his small hands.  , MAGA , 5 and counting! , Not nearly as quick as you would have if you didn\\'t post a drooling response to any TD post. , Don\\'t think they\\'ll ban you for that. Everyone knows MAGA means My Anus Gushes Abruptly.  It\\'s a magical condition many of his supporters are apparently proud of having seeing as how they keep saying it. , It\\'s not hard. I posted one comment on there and all I did was say something along the lines of his hair being funny and they banned me. They\\'re a very sensitive bunch. , I think it took me roughly 3 minutes.

Say some dumb shit, dummy! , MAGA is not bad in itself. MAGA the Trump way... is.  , Let\\'s not get banned from T_D, instead go in there, select one of the top posts.. and down vote every single comment..  or just scroll through and down vote every post.. if we all do this we can keep them off the front page.  , I\\'m banned from The_Donald and HillaryClinton.

It\\'s a cancer metastasis. , This one has been around for almost a year. Only now did it amass the power to go to /r/all. , :( , Da comrade. , It\\'s such a low effort one too.

Paging u/CommanderBS and u/p3ppino please end me , When you understand that the company that owns reddit can fake any data of any post, you start to wonder if there\\'s a monetary value to spamming Trump paranoia. , Agreed.  American trump supporter here.  Wish we could all just fucking post about normal shit for once.  Seriously thinking about leaving Reddit.  Community is cancer these days. , Well if you read the Brock paper, according to his outline, this is only the beginning. \\n\\nHis goal is to normalize slander against Trump (and/or anyone not a democrat) so better get used to it until there\\'s a social media platform that is willing to stand up to it.\\n\\nNot that republicans are victims or anything, but that\\'s the directive of media matters and they have billions in backing so its not going anywhere anytime soon.  , ...when US politics stop being important to a US-based site, probably. , Instead of writing this comment you could have added it to your filter and never had to look upon it.  , I\\'m guessing about 4 years, but the sooner the better. , yeah it usually stops after the election.

It\\'s becoming work. , In about 4 years my friend. , The Pro-Trump subreddits do not allow dissent or long-term discourse on a subject. They ban summarily. Deal with it.\\n\\nr/EnoughTrumpSpam does too, but they\\'re just emulating r/T_D to make a point. , There can\\'t be a list because they keep making more.\\n\\nThey don\\'t understand what makes a sub successful, so they just make another clone of their previous effprts and claim that this time it\\'ll definitely work. It\\'s to be expected coming from communists, frankly. , I hate it so much. I\\'m American by the way. Throughout the election I kept hoping reddit would go back to normal after election day. I think it might be ruined forever. This is reddit now. Same goes for Facebook, dinner with my family, and holidays. All are less enjoyable than before the election cycle.  , The damn butthurt have butthurt the butthurt. , As a non-american I\\'m fucking sick of this shit. I don\\'t give a fuck about politics but it keeps coming up even on non political subreddit. I\\'m gonna upvote every pro-Trump post now just to spite reddit. , Add the subs you don\\'t like instead of writing comments.

This person is making an \"alternative facts\" joke, ha ha ha. SO original, classic wit!!! So smart!.....  , Stop having a child as president. , Eleven. Months. Old. Faggot.      , Because it\\'s a low effort way to get the sub to the front page. This isn\\'t how the google images algorithm works and asking for upvotes is against the Reddit rules, but for some reason it happens on pretty much a daily basis. , It\\'s also The_Donalds staple supply of posts on their front page. , Because it\\'s a way of getting around Reddit\\'s \"no asking for upvotes\" rule. It\\'s like a little kid holding their hand half an inch from their sibling and insisting that they aren\\'t actually touching them.  , Because they are 12? , What\\'s funny is they could not even get it right....\"she\" is the key word.  , >a community for 11 months\\n\\nlol , Votebotted you mean.

Some retard is actually spending money on these votebots lmfao. , It\\'s that new Reddit \"algorithm\" , I literally have to filter 1 a day at this point. , It\\'s hilarious and pathetic at the same time.  , Suspicious isn\\'t it , Instant filter. , If only David Brock and his wealthy backers had put as much money and effort into helping the poor and disenfranchised as they put into astroturfing sites like reddit,  the democrats might have actually won the election.   , PedoBlue really giving it a boost , haha maybe more people hate donald trump than people like him?\\n\\ndont be surprised and dont blame it on an algorithm alone.\\n\\n , 16k upvotes. I\\'m sure we\\'re all paid CTRers. \\n\\nOr maybe it\\'s just that the vast majority (not an exaggeration) of US citizens would vote to impeach him now if we could. , Lol so you\\'re saying the only way it could get up voted to the top is a payola conspiracy? Couldn\\'t be that 3 million more people voted for the other candidate and this president has a record disapproval rating? Nah, it\\'s got be a conspiracy. Everyone loves that orange turd as much as you do.  , George Soros is paying the entire planet to protest against your messiah Mr Twittler.  That dude is loaded!  I get 100 internet dollars for every trumpanzee I troll.  , Brand new? homie look at how long we\\'ve been here , I don\\'t understand. You can block a sub on r/all. I did that for The_Donald (and a few other subs, r/overwatch I\\'m looking at you) and it has made it much better. , You\\'re free to leave and never come back :) , Look guys, I fownd a widdle snowfwake! , What are you talking about? The_donald hits the front page of /r/all constantly often by using the same \"upvote this\" crap.  \\n\\n , [deleted] , What? I\\'ve seen it on the front page 3 or 4 times in the last two days.  , They have to make a new one once they all realize everyone has filtered them and it\\'s only them left. They\\'re trying so hard 😂 , Funny how almost everyone complaining about these subs is a trump supporter. Trump supporters aren\\'t supposed to like these subs and there probably wouldn\\'t be so many of them if everyone opposing wasn\\'t banned from t_D while posting crap like \"oh where all are the liberals now with their arguments\".  , Notice how the majority of comments here are saying pretty much what you did, and that there are only 7k+ members in this Sub, yet this hits all.... Hrmmm.... , At least with the Donald Trump supporter base, I just had to filter out The_Donald and that was the end of seeing their garbage. The anti-Trump folks though, I end up having to filter a new subreddit every other day so my page isn\\'t filled with spammy propaganda.  , Always 1 more than you would like. , I mean this one has existed for a while. , They don\\'t understand what makes a sub good, so they keep making new ones in the hope that this time they\\'ll get it\\n , [deleted] , I have no idea what this post is trying to say. That it\\'s suspicious that a post with low upvotes is high on all? That\\'s not how all works. It just has to be hot within its own subreddit in comparison to other posts there. Which could mean 100 upvotes if it\\'s a small sub. , Politics isn\\'t just \"Oh I won/lost this term. Guess things are gonna be this way for the next few years!\"  , And seem to want to terraform the earth by ignoring climate change... , Lizard people isn\\'t partisan conspiracy theory. See...

You really want to add up which side has more Potemkin Village subreddits? , Oh boy, another comment about how it\\'s another anti-trump subreddit.  , Idk it\\'s pretty funny seeing all the triggered trump supporters  , It is legit and not paid for. Totally legit , Attacking someone on their looks? Tolerant left lol , Put my thoughts into words , Well, the election is over. This is now filed under \"politics\" and \"the end is nigh\".  , 90% of the comments are triggered trump supporters crying about these posts lol , How\\'s that \"lock her up\" thing going? Trump doesn\\'t seem to give a shit about any of that anymore, huh? You still hoping with all your little hopes that she\\'s going to prison? Yeah, get back to me on that when she\\'s being processed. , You truly are a fucking idiot if you think Conway is the reason Trump won the election.

If this gets enough up votes it will show up in google images , And yet again proving you mentally challenged fuck sticks can\\'t post a single thing without sounding like a middle school bully.

Have a nice cry tonight \\'haha... they may\\'ve won but we post mean pictures.. th-that\\'s the real victory, s-silly trumpers\\' , >what is /r/all , Because he is your god and saviour. \\n\\nAnd spez is busy banging his sister. , Leave Hillary out of it. , They are almost like cicadas.  , I wonder how Cankles Bloodclot is?

Pathetic. , You fucked your life when you voted for Trump. , username checks out. , Cryptkeeper , Janice from the Muppets , People that dislike Trump keep filtering Trump related subreddits. And the ones that truly hate him are obsessed with him just as the pro-trumpers. However this is a much smaller group. Which means if they don\\'t keep using new subreddits their posts won\\'t appear on r/all. Since people who put on a filter will not see it on the other subreddits and thus not upvote it to get it higher on r/all. \\n\\nThe second aspect of it, you need way less upvotes to get 1 post on r/all from 1 subreddit. So if you want to get 10 posts on r/all, if you were to do so from 1 subreddit this would be practically impossible. But if you use 10 different subreddits, you can get them all on r/all. \\n\\nThis is simply a tactical attack towards The_donald who doesn\\'t need all these techniques to get stuff on r/all, they have a big enough and dedicated base to be able to get things high upvoted by themselves. \\n\\nAnti trump posts gain in upvotes when they hit r/all. And trump posts gains mass downvotes when they hit r/all (though with the filter system, its a bit less now). \\n\\nIt clearly shows people are organizing this, and are trying to force community views/opinions. I have seen cultural/community manipulation before, and this is just textbook material here.  , This is my main issue. Sure, create an anti-Trump sub by all means, but make one and stick to it. There\\'s about 6 or 7 (that I know of) all doing the same fucking shit on Reddit ATM. The dumb fucks can\\'t grasp that people are sick of it now and if they did all join forces, they\\'d outnumber T_D posts by about 3-1. But nooooo, let\\'s make ANOTHER sub with the same subject matter as all the others. Fucking stupid.\\n\\nAt least you know if you block T_D and that\\'s it, no more of their shite.  , Sharia blue , Bots. How do they work?\\n\\nIt\\'s OK though, it\\'s anti-Trump so the admin turn a blind eye to it. Sick to death of these pro and anti Trump subs. Just pile them all into one place and let them fucking attack each other and leave the rest of us alone. , Do you actually think people can\\'t vote unless they\\'re part of a sub?\\n\\nThe thing is that if /r/The_Donald has followers who watch this sub and begin to downvote it, it can quickly become \\'controversial\\' on /r/all. Or if a lot of this sub\\'s users upvote it because Kellyanne Conway is a piece of lying shit, then it can quickly hit the \\'rising\\' part of /r/all. Then once it hits there, more and more people *not* in the sub can upvote it.\\n\\nThus, why there\\'s 169,120 votes with 33,824 points and only 7,767 subscribers. I\\'ve seen it happen with more than one sub over the past month. , They got Michelle out of there. They are still fumigating and repairing all the door trim though. , Are you sure it wasn\\'t from NoFap \\n\\n>I\\'m about to be 28 and I\\'ve only realized this a year ago but officially stopped at the turn of the year.

And to be honest even if it wasn\\'t dumb, the implications of reddit admins pushing political shit to the front page is really minuscule. I mean maybe if, like everyone on the_donald, reddit is literally your entire life then it\\'s a big deal; but to anyone who has a life and is actually politically involved outside of the internet, the implications of reddit admins pushing some dumb meme to the front page is nothing.  , You also have to subscribe to upvote, lol. When has reddit had 6000 instant upvotes/subsciribers to anything in a matter of hours? Much less to one sub and one thread. Sad! , I upvoted this where\\'s my check?\\n\\nThis fucking Kelly Anne Cuntway is afucking disgrace to America. She needs to get duck punched so hard she fucking dies.

But thank god, we have another sub dedicated to talking about Donald Trump. , [deleted] , Thank you :) , Subbed :D , Bet I wouldn\\'t last 10 seconds inside of you , u scared? , Stop being a cuck and do it yourself. , Doubt they give a rat\\'s ass, we don\\'t need to ban someone that will just get downvoted. , Do it yourself, I\\'m on break , Nah.  , /r/conspiratard checking in , No just trying to push an agenda , > you start to wonder if there\\'s a monetary value to spamming Trump paranoia.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re only wondering that just now? , All about getting the customers to buy gold. Get more people who hate the other side and love their own and they get increased motive to buy gold and upvote as that is the only real voice most redditors feel they have. Posting is fairly useless to actually try to communicate since it\\'s so divided lots of posts and comments are rarely seen or down voted instantly. , And there were bombs in the WTC. , Paranoia? His Twitter is more than enough to be worried. Shit is reality. , I\\'ve cleaned pro-Trump spam with only r/TD (after its nerf though it appears more rarely), against him are many and are increasing by the day\\n\\nhttps://i.imgur.com/IOJd88n.png\\n\\nI guess reddit doesn\\'t care about those who don\\'t care about US politics at all , You made America cancer you fuck. , You support Trump. You\\'re the cancer. , They are already trying to bring their political shit in r/rule34 with their low-effort scribbles. This is getting too far. , Are you angry because you don\\'t want to see reddit\\'s reaction to Trump\\'s insane orders? I don\\'t get it.  , Please leave. , Please clap  , Fucking go. Crawl under a rock and never come out after what you\\'ve inflicted on this country you sad, stupid piece of garbage. , Go fuck yourself, you slimy, worthless piece of shit excuse for a person. , Why do you want America to die? , So leave. You made this shit normal by voting for him, you don\\'t get to dictate how people react. , I love when Trump supporters complain about political spam on Reddit. Pot meet kettle. , Google and Facebook are US based also, your point is? , Right, let\\'s ignore our opposition instead of confronting them. Echo chambers are fun! /s , The pro Trump guys contain themselves in one sub.\\n\\nThe anti Trumps guys just spam random subreddits. , > subreddits\\n\\nYou say that like there\\'s any sub besides T_D that\\'s pro Trump.  , Yeah, the whole \"The opposition are terrible people, and we\\'re going to act just like them, but trust us, we\\'re not also terrible people\" attitude never quite resonated with me for some reason. , [deleted] , You keep thinking that... , It is literally in the rules of TD to be a circle jerk. Why do people think it would be otherwise?  , Except they aren\\'t making a point at all, just fools of themselves.  , Yeah, but they only have the one sub. You fucking crybabies have to make a new one every two days because people filter them all out since they\\'re filled with nothing but spam and garbage posts about DAE DRUMPF IS HITLER LEL , And also fuck off with that shit because people were getting banned from /r/politics for dissenting opinions. Explain to me how that\\'s ANY different at all, you thick moron.  , [deleted] , Then we need a plugin which auto updates, and maybe even downvotes. , This sub is 11 months old, so.. , Many Americans are sick of it too. , Oh yet another racist cuck. Fuck off back to your safe space, Nazi.  , She\\'s not wrong, she\\'s just alt-right. , So then say \"we don\\'t know exactly how many attended the inauguration, but it sure seemed like an endless sea from our perspective!\" Ostensibly honest, still spins the situation in your favor, *doesn\\'t conflict with actual estimates of the crowd size*. Basically, just normal, measured political speech.\\n\\nInstead of doing that, they flat out lied. The concept of \"alternative facts\" simply doesn\\'t hold up, no matter how gently apologetic you are about it. , [deleted] , Lol spicer was straight up making claims and comparisons about trumps crowd and flatly misstating the number of people who watched.  Kelly Anne called this an \"alternative fact.\"  It\\'s not a situation where there are two reasonable narratives.  It\\'s a situation where I\\'m saying 10 > 5 and your \"alternative fact\" is 5=10.  The two cannot coexist.\\n\\n\\nEven spicer walked his comments back in press conferences that followed by trying to say that he meant more people viewed it through media like live streaming etc.  Kelly Anne could not think of this spin on the spot though so she came up with a bullshit line that you could tell she sort of regretted the second she blurted it out. , \"alternative facts\" seems pretty dead on to a pandering business man. Ever buy a used car from a dealership?. \\n-\"How did you acquire this vehicle? What is it\\'s history?\"\\n-\"It was a trade in by an elderly lady who drove it to church for several years. Real light use. mint condition. It\\'s the best.\"\\n-Buys car for 3,000 dollars.\\n- Carfax: Purchased at auction for 500 bucks. , [deleted] , Hahahahahahahahahahaha This guy made a this guy is making an obvious joke joke. What a smart guy you deserve much better content here have this original non obvious joke on me!\\n\\n\\nA horse walks into a bar. The bartender says, “Hey.”\\n\\nThe horse says, “You read my mind, buddy.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHaha is that more to your liking? , I didnt vote for him. But damn it I will next time. Just to get back at you fucks for all these annoying subs , Still a shitty sub. \\n\\nFaggot lol. I bet you think trumpets are immature also lol.  , algorithm=whatever the fuck spez does , 30k upvotes?  There\\'s some shady shit going on here , [deleted] , And it never worked , So basically it\\'s an electronic nannernannerbooboo. , That\\'s your fact. He\\'s discussing alternative facts  , [deleted] , none of the post on this sub even crack 100 votes, its pretty obvious this post used bots. , That retard\\'s name is [David Brock](http://therightscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/david-brock.jpg), and he\\'s one of the most unsettling and creepy human beings (if you can call him that) ever to walk this earth. , [deleted] , It\\'s not some retard, it\\'s some acquisitoins manager at media matters working under the operations directors orders. So essentially david brock/george soros.  , I\\'m a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\\n\\n- [/r/drama] [Top minds uncover sinister plot to make Trump appear unpopular.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/5s05mu/top_minds_uncover_sinister_plot_to_make_trump/)\\n\\n[](#footer)*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don\\'t vote in the other threads.) ^\\\\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*\\n\\n[](#bot) , Yes, we\\'re all bots. \\n\\nThe majority of this country that disapprove ( worse than not approve) of him are all robots.\\n , I\\'ve been subscribed here for nearly a year, shit-for-brains. , Nah, it\\'s all of the people that are fucking sick of the Donald. And guess what, there are hundreds of thousands of us. Better hope your filter list doesn\\'t have a limit. \\n\\nEdit: it seems I triggered a bunch of cuck-suckers who came out of their safe space lol. SAD!  , m\\'lgorithm , Algorithm^TM , new censorrithm , It actually is, it gives added weight to new and smaller subs compared to larger more established ones. Its why porn has become such a force in r/all since the change. Minimal subs, overall low average upvote count, but once anything gets some steam behind it, its smashes right on through to the front page and the nature of boobs on the internet means anything can get some traction.\\n\\nYou dont need to be sarcastic here, it was actually explained during the algorithm change. , And yet you are still here... , It reeks of politics. , But then I can\\'t downvote them. :( , Actually helping people does not make you money. Pushing an agenda that results in businesses and governments acting in your favor does. , A vast majority of US citizens didn\\'t even vote the first time around so I wouldn\\'t bet on it. , When are you people going to get that the vast majority dont care? I voted trump because hes funny. , That\\'s why these losers keep making new ones. , Except ever single day at least 2 more subreddits centered around Trump appear on /r/all.  , I understand T_D, but why Overwatch? Now Overwatch_LFT, that\\'s a whole other thing.  , True, unless they keep creating new subs all the time. At least T_D keep their filth in one place.  , Believe me I try, but It\\'s like cutting off the head of a hydra. 2 more Donald Trump subreddits pop up to take it\\'s place. Also I\\'m primarilly on mobile where it\\'s not so simple. , There\\'s actual uses to this site other than spamming pictures of trump and his administration which does literally nothing.   , Isn\\'t that what Trump said to the crybabies? , Wow, what a great rebuttal! Did you make that up yourself? , ^ Liberalism is a mental disorder. , Wow... Not often a reddit comment makes me physically cringe. Gonna teach me the ways of the blade, master? May I be privy to ur neckbeard ways Plz?   , Difference is you can filter them, dumb ass. It\\'s one sub, versus you cunts who make a new one to shove this narrative down everyone\\'s throat when we just want reddit to be back to normal and you all to fuck off.  , They don\\'t understand that what makes a sub great is community participation - if you have that, like T_D does, you don\\'t care about being filtered. , I don\\'t even see the point of all the different ones, it\\'s all the same content anyway  , There are 10+ pro Donald subs, this is disingenuous.  , If anti-trumpers could get corporate funding and around the clock workers from a garbage organization like infowars, I\\'m sure we could stick to one sub. \\n\\nUnfortunately not everyone knows that one exists over another, so there are many. If we could all coagulate into one sub that would be awesome, then people won\\'t have to bitch about it.  , Guess people must really be pissed off two weeks into the administration.  Are you complaining about the spam or the bias? Both of which T_D gleefully supported when it suited therm. ,  I\\'m banned from the_D too, just curious as to how many of these subs there has to be. , -1 pls , Did not know that. , This sub is 11 months old. Nice try. , You have been banned from ~~r/Pyongyang~~ r/The_Donald. , All I said was \"I\\'m Mexican and I\\'m not a rapist.\" and I was banned. , I was banned for asking what people thought about the Steele Dossier allegations. Not before a couple of replies were posted saying it was false news. , no libtards are allowed on that sub thats why you were banned probably. You probably presented your \"facts\" from a cnn or huffington shit article, right? , Same, I responded to someone who said that 99% of college professors are liberals who are trying to indoctrinate their students and I made the mistake of saying throughout my two degrees a few professors exposed their politics and more were republicans than democrats and I got banned for spreading disinformation. Hilarious.  , It is in the rules to be circle jerk at TD. It is for high energy and everyone over there knows that. Some are there for the echo chamber, some for the LULz, but most because they do support the President and believes in the movement. Thinking you can break the rules and not be punished is what is bizarre, no? , It\\'s not a place for debate or discussion. It doesn\\'t pretend to be. \\n\\nIt exists to be a hype machine. That is its purpose.  , It is bizarre but we have fun there! , Once it gets on the rising portion of r/all it takes off, it seems like big subreddits are allowed 1 or 2 posts in r/all at a time opening up space for the smaller subreddits to sneak in.\\n , No it\\'s not ranked like that at all lmao you\\'re talking about something that you literally don\\'t have a clue about. Nobody knows the algorithm and people can only speculate.  , Then maybe go out and fucking do something? spamming reddit won\\'t get shit done. , 8 , [deleted] , Oh man, this is a big part of the plot to [The Arrival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arrival_(1996_film\\\\)), except with aliens. , how has your personal carbon footprint changed since Trump got elected?\\n\\nThe pragmatic conservative stance is that government taxing and spending billions of dollars to host climate meetings and climate studies and climate treaties doesn\\'t actually do much to stop climate change. It\\'s disappointing to me that so many of them seem to reject science, but from a pragmatic perspective it really doesn\\'t matter. Climate change is not a problem Obama could solve and it\\'s not a problem Trump can solve; it\\'s a problem for all of us to solve. Consider using Trump\\'s tax cut money to put solar panels on your roof, get a Tesla, eat less meat, and stop blaming the biggest problem of our time on lawmakers who never get anything done in either direction. , It\\'s dumb nonetheless though right? , What\\'s with the parens? I\\'m out of the loop on that :/ , You forgot /s\\n\\nEdit: if not... You are honestly thinking this was a reference to their body? I\\'m talking about the face, little snowflake. \"How dare they compare the physique to that of a lizard!\" If that\\'s what you think it\\'s gotta be weird. \"Honey, do these pants make me look fat?\" \"Well, I\\'m not gonna say you look like a lizard but...\" , To be fair, hillary clinton and tim kaine both look like lizards too  , It\\'s just hard to see that these subs for the most part even if they are here get popular or front paged seemingly out of nowhere.   , Dont go to that subreddit for discussion. It is not there for that. Just like going to Anal Happy Mouth Party subreddit and discuss kittens. Try a different place like /r/AskTrumpSupporters/\\n\\nWhats so hard for people to understand a subreddit about a topic is not a place to discuss kittens. \\n\\n\\nEdit shit your account is a new account and paid for..... my comment stands..  , He\\'s just triggered because he\\'s a whiny crybaby Trumplet. , Yeah because your infallible leader has never attacked someone on their looks. You lost the moral high ground argument a long time ago. , Literally the main tool of the Alt right.  And you decry it\\'s use when its unpleasant?  , Don\\'t worry, all those comments from Lord Trump were just media taking it out of context. , I think what /u/jordanleite25 was trying to convey is she looks like she\\'s been grabbed by the pussy wayyyyy too many times, which, given her circumstances with the predator I chief, isn\\'t that unreasonable. Plausible deniability. Checkmate atheists , It\\'s just another r/saltmine. , Everyone who isn\\'t with the kill Trump circlejerk is tired of these, which is about 99% of reddit.  , I\\'m not a Trump supporter, but I too am tired of these Trump posts spammed all over /r/all. I\\'m not triggered, I\\'m not crying, but you\\'re acting like anybody who doesn\\'t want to see constant anti Trump spam must be a disgruntled Trump fan. That\\'s just not true.  , It\\'s not \"triggered\" to want you guys to fuck off. If anyone is \"triggered\" (lol are you ten years old), it\\'s your camp who constantly has to make new subs to try and force this idea down our throat. \\n\\nSit down, shut up, and fuck off. Better yet just drop dead so you don\\'t reproduce.  , Or normal people that are tired of your spam bullshit.  You\\'re ruining reddit. , Hey buddy how\\'s the Clinton foundation going? All that good they where doing for the world and they just shut it down when she didn\\'t become president. Your a fucking idiot u/cran-baisins please Darwin yourself from the human species.  , Hows that \"impeach trump\" going?\\n\\nNot too well eh?  , Huma, is that you? , It\\'s going fine actually. The pieces are getting put in place, and the data gathering is taking place.   \\nYou have to realize that Trump himself can\\'t go after her, that\\'s not his job, per se. Whar he did was tell those whose its their job to investiguate whatever they want.  \\nThe investigation can\\'t come from him, it\\'ll come from the apropriate dept. at about 16 month in.  \\nGet ready to have all that rammed up your ass summer 2018.  \\nPut a remind me bot on this. , Trump is so far ahead now, he doesn\\'t even think about her anymore. , She was hugely instrumental in Trump\\'s election. What, do you think that she isn\\'t capable of that just because she\\'s a woman or something? , Conway dude not Crowley  , Are you the hype-man of your cell? , No you don\\'t understand. The theory is definitely sound, it\\'s the execution that has caused it to fail every time it\\'s been tried. What we really need to do is just give it one more try, and this time ~~socialism~~ anti-trump subreddits will definitely work. , American Bridge is trying a new angle! , How\\'s it supposed to \"work\" lol it\\'s not a competition  , [deleted] , It may not be new but randomly going from 10 point posts to a 15,000 point post is certainly new\\n\\nBut hey it\\'s just the algorithm \\'promoting\\' smaller subs, right? Which is why this only ever happens to these anti-Trump subs right? , first time ever getting on /all. , As is most Trump supporters, you have as much knowledge about communism as you do the candidate you voted for  , only a side of beef. , Fuck, I love you guys. , I don\\'t care, I don\\'t follow her nor do I watch news interviews. , They\\'re making up for their tiny hands. , **Here\\'s a sneak peek of [/r/the_meltdown](https://np.reddit.com/r/the_meltdown) using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/the_meltdown/top/?sort=top&t=all) of all time!**\\n\\n\\\\#1: [<----- Number of Trumpets who will MELT DOWN over Comey recommending no charges from the Weiner emails](https://np.reddit.com/r/the_meltdown/comments/5bhvzr/number_of_trumpets_who_will_melt_down_over_comey/)  \\n\\\\#2: [Our burn centers can\\'t treat a burn of this magnitude.](http://imgur.com/meHUZck.jpg) | [984 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/the_meltdown/comments/5bv9mu/our_burn_centers_cant_treat_a_burn_of_this/)  \\n\\\\#3: [The_D has two posts talking about YUGE voter fraud in Florida.

In reality less people care about spamming and upvoting anti-trump shit all day (Even if most of reddit doesn\\'t like Trump, it takes a lot of effort to hate trump so much.)\\n\\nThis is just to abuse reddit getting one or two posts to stick and then leave the sub to rot most of the time. , This is clearly bot brigading and potentially another an admin backed algorithm adjust because it aligns with their politics. It shot up out of nowhere, at a ridiculous speed, and in a dead sub. Even legitimate Trump criticisms don\\'t get upvoted this highly and so quickly.\\n\\n>because Kellyanne Conway is a piece of lying shit\\n\\nIt\\'s amazing to me your level of pure hate though. All because she said \"alternative facts\" instead of alternative perspective. Are you some kind of misogynist? \\n\\nNot everyone is as fanatical as you. Just because a couple posts a month turn out like this doesn\\'t make it normal, in fact it makes it more suspect. , Obviously not. , [Stay triggered](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CVpda1fWcAA6Vr3.jpg:large) , compared to fakenews and the fact that she forced the msm to decide on correcting her mistake by proving trumps policies are effective...again...you dont know that because you filter out anything that you dont want to hear , ...no? , Yeah i cant believe Connway said she landed under Bosnian sniper fire!  , They always lied about the drone program when brought up, do you really think we had an honest president and staff for 8 years straight? You act like we just begun having a flawed democracy or something lol its been this way for awhile bud , Hope you enjoy the next 8 years :) , Ok then, how does it happen? , I think that giving less important issues (like comments from someone with no legislative authority) while other more important and more influential topics go by with little to no discussion. Her marks are, in my book, completely moot when compared to say ADEM which snuck by probably only 1 out of every 100 people aware of it (if even that). Y\\'know, things that ACTUALLY affect the political climate. Not some TMZ version of the news that no one with actual influence is influenced by. The dog and pony show is SUPPOSED to be outrageous and upsetting. If it weren\\'t, you wouldn\\'t be wasting your time on it just like they want. They want people to be eating this all up like reality T.V. as opposed to out actually doing something. Talk is meaningless. \"Words are wind.\" But that\\'s what I\\'ve been taking away from all of this. Outrage at these absurdities is fine, so long as you couple it with an actual remedy.  , ...what? , Hmmmm All these comments and votes say otherwise. 2 wrongs making a right? Let\\'s just let lying win! , lol you guys are a bunch of snowflake. Low test beta males with clit dick syndrome. :) , Apparently 100. , Dam near im over this shit im over this fuckin divide these altright mafuckers are fuckin up my country. Like what the flying fuck. , Lol.  Thanks for taking the time to stalk my history. Your attempt at the \"rolling\" diabetes joke shows your ignorance.  Look up Type 1 diabetes and then get back to me. , [deleted] , Triggered , maybe but random low population subs keep getting 20-30k votes everyday and i keep having to filter them out. I\\'m from Europe for gods sake i don\\'t need this shit. , what? , Suck a dick faggot , Yep that\\'s exactly what I mean. And now y\\'all goobers are trying to copy that tactic and have taken it to the extreme. You\\'ve become what you hate. , Fuck you too. This left right bullshit again. go to hell  , **REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!** , Do you say votebotting because you can\\'t possibly comprehend people upvoting anti-Trump posts? , Yeah.  Wanna type about it?  , *rolling eyes emote* , Trumpets realize that cuck isn\\'t an insult to anyone but them, right? Normal people don\\'t give a shit what others consenting adults do in their bedroom.  , [deleted] , Trumpets sleep at the same time, it\\'s understandable  , They don\\'t have enough mods. It\\'s another anti Trump sub that magically reaches the front page despite having very few subscribers, and next to no traffic. Another reddit miracle!  , [removed] , I have low energy so it might take me a while. , Cuck, cuck, CUUUCK!! , Yes lol.... , That\\'s funny cuz your history says you said \"this is stupid, you are all stupid, ban me.\"\\n , That\\'s their safe space, you had no business forcing your ~~liberal~~ libtard views down their throats. , Stealing our memes... Embarassing. , Lol I\\'m chill. I just noticed liberals listen more whenever you say something is *scary* , Yeah but they have like 50x as many subscribers  , [deleted] , [deleted] , Lol are you fucking retarded it took months upon months to grow that subscriber base.  , Not surprisingly from a Trump supporter, that is factually and demonstrably inaccurate , What? , Check your bank account. , Yes, but think about the *[implication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yUafzOXHPE)*. , Oh that\\'s just silly. I doubt he\\'ll get re-elected, unless he defies all odds and ends up being a fantastic president, but do you really think he\\'ll be impeached? Even if he did something insane enough to warrant it (possible, but unlikely,) impeachment requires a simple majority in the house, and a 2/3 majority vote from the senate, which is never going to happen.  , -Trump will never be the GOP nominee\\n\\n-Trump won\\'t keep his staggering lead in the primaries\\n\\n-Trump has hit his ceiling, it\\'s all over now\\n\\n-Trump will not be made the nominee despite his landslide primary win\\n\\n-Trump will never be elected President\\n\\n-Trump\\'s campaign is over now that *this* has hit the news (repeat x10,000)\\n\\n-Trump\\'s bubble will burst before November 5th\\n\\n-Accusing Trump of working with those dirty commie Russians will surely end his campaign\\n\\n-Clinton is toying with Trump at these debates, she\\'s not losing\\n\\n-Trump is only winning states we expected him to win\\n\\n-Trump won the battleground states by thin margins that doesn\\'t even count\\n\\n-Trump won\\'t be confirmed by the electoral college, they\\'ll vote no confidence\\n\\n-Trump will never be inaugurated, some guy said he had prostitutes pee on him\\n\\n-President Trump will surely be impeached and removed from office (you are here)\\n\\n-President Trump will never fufill his promise to end the TPP\\n\\n-President Trump will never build the wall (most people are here)\\n\\n-President Trump will never conquer space for the glory of mankind\\n\\n-God Emperor Trump will never be enter suspension to prolong his life and be sealed into a throne to guide humanity for the next 100,000 years\\n\\nJust accept your future , [deleted] , I don\\'t!

I got banned for saying Stalin did not do a good thing when he purposly killed milliins in ukraine with artifical famine , At least they are fun to laugh at.  , its almost as if the majority of internet users aren\\'t pro-trump, and that trump\\'s douchebagging is a constant topic of interest lately. crazy how the people on the internet constantly discuss things they are thinking! , Bestof: \"Guy explains why Donald Trump is bad\" 32,129 points  , Okay, good. , I find it funny that he went from creepy Biden to BidenBro with no explanation.  , Another butt hurt shit sub. , Added, thanks.  , Sure buddy, \"sweet memes\" or you think \"libtards\" are actually fraudulent voters even though there is 0 evidence.

This video was made by a Muslim women, so they can\\'t just throw out the racist card. , Or, maybe, the anti-trump subs and posts are just more popular than the pro-trump posts.  \\n  \\nFucking wild idea, huh. , Looks like the sub gets a bunch of subscribers on the rare occasions a post hits r/all. \\n\\nBut of course you\\'re clearly right that it\\'s a massive conspiracy and everyone is plotting against you. , You mean with giant spikes on inaug day and \"Muslim ban\" day? Seems plausible, no?\\n\\n , Uh, there are that many. T_d, hillaryforprison, wikileaks, conspiracy, uncensorednews, etc. Trump supporters literally did the same thing.  , And I\\'ve heard that t_D uses bots. And eats locusts. \\n\\nMan it sure is nice to not have to substantiate any of my claims anymore! , The sad thing is, it\\'s completely ineffective. They\\'re attempting to use a cheap knockoff tactic of memery that we employ at the Donald that simply is just laughable when directed against us. It just fuels the fire.  , > Edit: Does this sub\\'s growth chart look organic?\\n\\nyes, how do you think a sub\\'s growth is supposed to look? \\n\\nalso, I\\'m a CTR shill payed to foster distrust in trump ia posts on this retarded website. hillary pays me in cheese pizza, and the jews totally did 9/11\\n\\nKONY2012 , I have read that pro Trump posters are donkeys. But hey, it\\'s just what I\\'ve read.  , Fuck you scumbag  , > It\\'s clearly coordinated. I have read they use IRC to coordinate pushing anti-Trump posts to the front page. That way they get around the /r/all post limit.\\n\\nHoly shit. Who would do that? Use the reddit algorithm to show the posts they want? Bunch of savages in this town, I can\\'t believe this is the first time it\\'s happened.\\n\\n/s , Go to Reddit through your browser and in the upper right, click on the drop down to pick \\'desktop site\\' then you can go to /all and add it to your filter list. I just did it.  , It encourages a behavior of creating a new sub just to send the message \"dae drumpt is Hitler xdddddddd upboats to the left xd\". Basically clogging r/all , Vote manipulation.  , Of course not,with t_d I can just filter with RES,but with the increasing amount of anti-trump spam in r/all we do need admins to step in and do something about it instead of relying \"well if you don\\'t like it just filter it lol\" , You can safely add:\\n\\n/r/news\\n\\n/r/worldnews , I will ride with you to Banhalla!\\n\\n~~WITNESS~~ BAN ME! , Also r/pics , [deleted] , Should be the default filter list. , Maybe so, but I was frustrated that posts and comments from The_Donald could not be discussed exactly as they are shown.  Users entering those posts could only see an echo chamber of support.  Now hopefully they can see those same exact posts with actual discussion.  But I do see your point. , But can we have some that are negative??? I\\'m sick of all of these pro-Trump subs! Where\\'s a sub for people that don\\'t support Trump? A place where they can gather and not have pro-Trump jokes, memes, articles, pictures, and discussions rammed down their throat. I know it\\'s unpopular opinion to not support Donald Trump so I\\'m cool with censoring the place and being selective, but can\\'t we have just one??? , Protip, you can just copy paste this entire list into the filter box, and not do it individually. , Check youre privilege REEEEEEEE , Where are all the pro-trump subreddits? \\n\\nLOW ENERGY , Man that filter feature came in handy now!

You\\'re so fortunate to not be a doctor from a banned country who can\\'t return home to America.\\n\\nBut you don\\'t care about others plight. You\\'re a coddled first world baby.

If you have politics on a website that the CEO calls for freedom of speech on, you should not favors certain subs.  , You missed /r/TrumpForPrison, /r/Fuckthealtright, /r/AntiTrumpAlliance, /r/MarchAgainstTrump, etc, etc.\\n\\nMy filter list right now is thirty variations of anti-Trump subreddits, thirty variations of Me_IRL/BPT (since they\\'re literally the same thing), and The_Donald.\\n\\nWithout it, /r/all is completely unusable.  , If youre living in the us regardless what side your on, now is THE time to care about politics. If not then im sorry about reddit. , No, all you fucking liberals have been the cancer. Trump supporters haven\\'t been rioting and shit everytime Trump opens his mouth. But the left have been losing their collective minds over people having different opinions than them.  , Call him daddy. , We\\'re fine, y\\'all are the ones who are mad and constantly complaining like whiny bitches. , Thank for your contribution fucktard , I wouldn\\'t call a person (or a community) cancer just for not having the same beliefs at me. The hate between reddit and Trump supporters still surprises me, they\\'re still people, right?  , That\\'s very bigoted and fascist of you to put someone down like that for their beliefs. , But what will we do without him if he leaves Reddit?! Come on everyone on this site, lets change our ways. I wouldn\\'t be able to get past seeing him go.  , Hey.  Fuck you.   , Yeah! He needt to check gis priviledge REEEEE! President trump will actually have an effect on our lives! ( he wont ) , Wow that\\'s some real in depth analysis. \\n\\nYou\\'re a retard. I hope you\\'re sterile because you\\'re busy calling everyone who thinks a certain way cancerous just because they disagree with you. Does your mommy still pick out your clothes for you in the morning, too?  , You sound very fascist and authoritative to me automatically putting down people with dissenting opinions.  , [deleted] , [deleted] , kellyanne conway rule 34? I think I might want to throw up... , No im angry cause I just want to read something that isn\\'t political and you guys have a fucking million subs.  Have one sub like us.   , Yeah that\\'s relevant.  Oh wait no it\\'s not.   , Hmm, you\\'re dehumanizing someone because of their political beliefs. You must be very progressive. , Haha. Insulting random People and calling them garbage without any personal provocation.... Let me guess, liberal? , Shareblue out in force. How is the shitty pay for working for Joseph Goebbels going, assholes? , REEEEEEEE Trumps a meanie , K , I don\\'t, I just want to use Reddit like normal again  , All I want to do is use Reddit without a MILLION anti trump sites, that too much for you to get. , And yours is...? , That US-based stuff might be the most-discussed things on a US-based site?\\n\\nDid *you* have a point? , Complaining about the existing of this sub isn\\'t exactly a good counter balance of the  echo chamber. Especially when this sub is the direct result of the_donald creating their own echo chamber. \\n\\nYour part of the_donald. You take part in a sub that bans everyone that disagrees why screaming \"where are the liberals now with their arguments. You do not get to complain about echo chambers. \\n\\nSeriously, this sub was created because the_donald bans everyone over the slightest criticism or reason because it\\'s a \"supporter\" subreddit but then all of you start whyning when this sub pops up? What did you expect? \\n  , It\\'s somehow okay for the Reddit admins to manipulate the algorithm to keep the Donald from reaching r/all as often, yet now there\\'s several anti Donald subs reaching it constantly. It\\'s okay for altright to get banned but fuckthealtright somehow is just fine. Free speech seems to only be free if you hate the president, which falls inline with the agenda of *free speech only applies to people that don\\'t say things that I find offensive*. Might as well just axe free speech from the constitution at this point and put an addendum in there covering trigger warnings and safe spaces.\\n\\nEdit: apparently everyone thinks I\\'m stupid. I\\'m aware Reddit is a privately owned company but if people are here for political discussions, some semblance of free speech is expected to be followed by its users. This site is and always has been a liberal safe haven and what we\\'re seeing now around the country is millions of people that don\\'t want to be associated with the word \"liberal\" anymore because it\\'s embarrassing. Look at the rise of extreme feminism, the world throat fucking us with Hillary Clinton and being called a racist rapist xenophobe Nazi misogynist for not voting for her, the silly racism of *white people are a big problem and here\\'s why: an op-ed by the white people at Huffington Post*, the people rioting and beating the living fuck out of opposing opinions at Berkeley, CNN/HuffPo/WaPo/NYT/Daily Beast the most embarrassing biased media entities of all time that sell straight up blatant lies to their customers in order to further the agenda, I could go on forever. Point is people come to Reddit for political discussion sometimes and it\\'s extremely wrong that the Donald is the only place you\\'re allowed to go if you don\\'t want to be brainwashed and turned into a transsexual blue haired septum pierced Starbucks employed tumblr cult leader in the process. , No they don\\'t. They\\'ve taken over r/conspiracy, r/wikileaks and largely r/sandersforpresident. They also spam reddit from places like r/hillaryforprison, r/dncleaks and r/uncensorednews.They don\\'t contain themselves to one subreddit _at all_. , The anti-Trump redditors are creating new subs because they are trying to get around the new /r/all algorithm that limits the number of posts from one sub. Note how even big subs can\\'t have more than a handful of posts on /r/all? Anti-Trumpers are coordinating, creating new subs, then mass upvoting them so they can get around the post limit on /r/all. \\n\\nI agree to disagree with anti-Trumpers. However, if we have to follow reddit\\'s rules, they should, too.\\n\\nLikely Shareblue has paid off the admins. , Then what are you doing here? , [deleted] , > The pro Trump guys contain themselves in one sub.\\n\\nThat isn\\'t even remotely true and you know it. , This is not at all true. Mr_trump,hillaryforprison etc. the list is very long.  , >The pro Trump guys contain themselves in one sub.\\n\\n***Oh hai, alt-facts.***\\n\\nIf that were true, there would be half as many comments on this post aline   , >contain themselves in one sub.\\n\\nNo, they have at least two; this is typical Trump BS. Two major pro-Trump subs? \"It\\'s practically just one.\" Two major anti-Trump subs? \"It\\'s practically three, calm down already.\"\\n\\nThey\\'re also the biggest brigaders on reddit.  , r/HillaryForPrison banned me with the message of \"Sad!\" when I questioned an assertion supposedly made by Hillary\\'s team. I wasn\\'t even criticizing it, just commented that I\\'d never heard it before.\\n\\nAlso, r/altright didn\\'t shut down voluntarily. It was banned for its practices. , /r/Tumblrinaction, and /r/kotakuinaction may as well be renamed /r/letsmakefunofstupidliberals by now.

They used the crowd size as a specific example of media bias, they used MLK\\'s bust as a specific example of media bias. It\\'s not about the crowd, it\\'s about the media\\'s representation of the crowd. It\\'s not about the bust, it\\'s about the media\\'s representation of the bust. Trump has been at war with a dishonest and biased media for 20 months and counting. , [deleted] , > spicer walked his comments back\\n\\nno he didn\\'t, watch the original press conference, watch the press conference where he \\'walked back\\' (he didn\\'t). His original quote was clearly about total audience and when asked about it in the \\'walk back\\' conference he pressed the reporter asking the question to read back the rest of the sentence that he was quoting. Spicer clearly meant total audience in his original statement. Just because the dishonest media misquotes him doesn\\'t mean he lied. , This isn\\'t the_cheeto boy. , It was more original, so I guess that\\'s a plus. , Ah yes. Voting out of spite against random internet people. Truly a sign of virtue.  , I hope there is still an America in 4 years time , It\\'s difficult to tell. The pro and anti-trump circle jerks are strong on Reddit and so once a cheap post asking for upvotes hits /r/all it\\'s imaginable that it could get a large number of votes. , Looks like the anti-Trumpers are winning hearts and minds\\n\\nBetween this and the UC Berkeley anti-free speech riots, they will definitely win in 2018! ...right? , deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3467  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/95653) , Inauguration day and the day he tried to ban the muslims.\\n\\nI\\'m no super genius but that code ain\\'t hard to crack. , You mean with giant spikes on inaug day and \"Muslim ban\" day?  Seems plausible, no? , Yeah, and Reddit allows it because it fits their anti-Trump agenda. It\\'s pathetic how obvious these people are. , I\\'m not a bot and I up vote every anti-donald post I see - I\\'m sure I\\'m not the only one. \\n\\nI think the front page algorithm is easy to \"game\" for small or new subreddits - if they get a moderate amount of up votes from a bunch of different people is has a disproportionate effect on front page placement. , AAAAH wtf is that thing , Or people just love silently triggering you people like this , Being a bot is quite the experience , I didn\\'t realize somebody had written an AutismBot so recently, but it\\'s very convincing  , And that\\'s somehow suppose to prove that it wasn\\'t votebotted? Look at other submissions in this sub, barely break 100 karma lol , [deleted] , Could\\'ve used an extra couple hundred thousand during the election , Hundreds of thousands my ass  , I don\\'t filter anything from my /r/all, but it\\'s kind of funny thinking everyone who is sick of /r/T_D posts already have that sub filtered, only to see dozens of ANTI-/r/T_D subreddit posts on their /r/all. :thinking: , I\\'m more fucking sick of politics. I can\\'t filter out politics from /r/All when dumbasses make a new subreddit every 3 seconds.  , Tee hee. Hundreds of thousand of you guys? Hahaha. Oh no the little libtard army is loose. Too cute. Anyways man just remember this always: you as a person and you as a group or party dont mean shit. At all. Trump is president for minimum 4 years and none of your whining and tantrums will change that.  , Too bad bitch.  Suffer.  Enjoy the next 4 years as he makes your life better and you ladies sit in stunned denial disbelief. , [deleted] , No it\\'s not lol. It\\'s CTR under a new name. And they still make shitty knock off memes that are completely ineffective and laughable.  , [deleted] , hahahahaha enjoy being salty ya little cuck cunt , Millions of us. FTFY , get out then lol , Yup, and it\\'s a disgrace that Reddit thinks they should he aggressively manipulating /r/all beyond uselessness  , not really, i saw this post, made this comment, and then filtered the subreddit.

It\\'s spam, plain and simple.  , I assume people get banned from one so they want to make their own.  , Because they hope that a lie repeated enough time will make it true. , This sub is fairly specific, though I\\'m not liking the fact they\\'ve started posting these kind of things though.

Safe spaces aren\\'t for questions, /r/AskTrumpSupporters is for the questions. After all, it\\'s not a safe space if you have an alternate place that\\'s for actual discussion, right? *Right?* , No you didn\\'t I looked through your comment history.  , nah brah i only listen to unbiased breitbart an i bin supportin my whole family since i was 11 and my grandad gave me 4 shotguns , [deleted] , \"Nobody knows the algorithm\" and \"it doesn\\'t work like that\" in the same breath.

There\\'s no reason why any normal person would have any idea what that means. , Calling someone ugly is body shaming but keep going high. , Yeah. Strange coincidence, huh? Almost like... David... Is that you? , How about just let the reddit \"free market\" decide and downvote people saying stupid things you disagree with?  They\\'ll be relegated to the bottom of the thread and you can show everyone how stupid it is?\\n\\nYou know as opposed to banning them for even suggesting something against the hive mind.  Kind of how you aren\\'t banned here ya know?  The safe space of T_D is politically unhealthy tbh.  /r/politics is full of liberals, but at least you don\\'t get banned for being a conservative.  It is literally a mental shield from having to critically think and no better than those losers who shut down milo\\n\\nBut hey I\\'m a free market kind of guy.   , [deleted] , You\\'re trying way too hard. , Who did Putin attack? , Of course he has.... that\\'s my point tho.

This time, this time it\\'ll work! , Well, its obvious by now CTR has a heavy influence on reddit, just look at the quality of posts on Politics. How the hell does a Buzzfeed article get to the front page on politcs? Not that many Real people would upvote that crap. With the new algorithm, they can make more anti trump posts hit the front page. Its just the more bullshit they spew, the more people see the truth, its counter intuitive.  , You\\'re right, there has definitely been an artificial inflation just now. But this sub *has* had an organic community for quite a while. I know this simply because I\\'ve browsed this sub every once in a while for some time. , What are you talking about. This sub has many posts with thousands of upvotes. Not everything is a conspiracy. A lot of people don\\'t like trump and many got banned from t_D. That\\'s all there\\'s to it.  , Congrats to them! , How is Pyongyang? Do you have enough water to go with your plate of dirt today? , ...\\n\\nTry reading the comment again.

Guys? Who do I deflect to now?!!?! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE , I\\'m willing to bet you were born with a lead spoon in your mouth. , Lying and making up facts to intentionally mislead people are two different things , I do think it\\'s approaching critical mass though, and that it will implode.\\n\\nDon\\'t know if it\\'ll save reddit though, the site could go the way of total echo chamber and still make money.  Even an obscure niche can survive on the internet, though it may take a hit in profit. , Wow, you seem pretty upset to go through all the trouble of looking through someone\\'s history, taking a screenshot, uploading it to imgur. Sad! , Unfortunately it does not yet come up when Googling \"let\\'s\" , How does it work then, hacker man? , I did describe him pretty well didn\\'t I  , 1) sure you are\\n\\n2) we don\\'t waste our time on people who wish to debate whether or not we\\'re \"a bunch of losers\"\\n\\n3) now you see exactly what I\\'m getting at , Well I\\'m not American but I\\'m honoured to be included on the winning side. Google \\'President of the United States\\' and have a cry - hey isnt it in your constitution that if you make enough snarky comments on the internet the president gets impeached? Keep posting, patriot!  , Well you are still fucked either way :) , Well I would never consider myself unbiased in this subject personally, since I do visit The_donald quite frequently. But I try to be unbiased when i try to explain things though. \\n\\nNow the result/effect of this on opinions? I think it is more so an experiment. I don\\'t think they even know what the effect will be, but they are trying to find out, for future use. \\n\\nIf I however take away the option that they are experimenting, then they are probably trying to make Trump seem less successful. For a president he gets a lot done, even though he is controversial. And this is horrible for the opposition party, since If Trump actually is successful this will thus eliminate democrats out of politics until they change their ways. \\n\\nSo if they can\\'t make Trump fail, they could be attempting to make people think he fails. Since logically speaking if people think Trump is not succeeding or getting anything done and what he does get done is horrible, it doesn\\'t matter to these people that he actually does the opposite. We saw the same behavior from the republicans towards Obama. Where they blew up some of the things obama did or didnt do, as the worst things out there. And there were many people who over time legitimately believed their narrative. \\n\\nI also saw something recently in the Old media, where news stories suddenly started to all reporting on Trumps presidency being Chaotic/Chaos. All of a sudden everyone says the same thing, to flood out all other news. \\n\\nBut in short its Narrative vs Narrative. Where exposure and a big following matters. And both sides are at fault. As long as it stays in this form though, it should be fine. But once the companies of the platforms start checking in with pushing narratives then you get a problem. (Example if reddit would try to suppress a political direction,... oh wait they did). Eitherway even though they did, they can only get away by doing minor things (example: any post on r/T_D that was stickied is invisible on r/all) and getting rid of unpopular politics, anything that is anywhere in the mainstream would destroy their image.  , Yep, got me there. I hate my own gender. Fuck all women, including myself. \\n\\nBut in actuality: when did I say it was the alternative facts? I said *she\\'s* a liar, and did not reference her covering up for her lying boss. I\\'m referencing, specifically, Bowling Green\\'s terrible massacre. You know, the massacre she made up so that she could try and speak up for the banning of seven predominantly Muslim countries?\\n\\nAdditionally, have you noticed that The_Donald is suddenly pushing constant reminders not to threaten or \"stoop to Liberal levels\"? There\\'s also constant mentions in the past few days about how liberals are coming in and downvoting comments and posts non-stop. So yes, if a bunch of people from The_Donald came in and downvoted a post, it\\'d hit controversial on /r/all, and then could get voted up quickly.\\n\\nI\\'m not saying it\\'s impossible for it to be a bot, but I\\'m also saying the squabbles and downvotes between different subs are throwing lots of posts onto the controversial part of /r/all that wouldn\\'t be there otherwise.\\n\\nP.S. \"Alternative perspective\" doesn\\'t mean anything. He wasn\\'t saying opinions. He would say something, go back and change it, or say something 100% false. That\\'s lying. \"Alternative perspective\" to most people would be an opinion. , >Left throws biggest temper tantrum in history of politics \\n\\n>I\\'m somehow triggered???\\n\\nCoollogicbro , :-D\\ndidn\\'t know about that! , no one cares if all of reddit sees this thread is what im saying \\n\\nim sure you have see all the posts from the donald on all and you didn\\'t change your mind, right? , Boomhower? , Bullshit.

Don\\'t forget reddit is an international site and virtually every other country already massively hates that guy. And trump didn\\'t even win the popular vote in your own country. So yes, its completely expected for trump to be hated on reddit, which has always been more liberal. , Probably because most people who use reddit realise he\\'s a blustering fool who is harming this country. , deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3959  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/58242) , This is a blatant lie.

We don\\'t create new subs to get around the single sub post limit. The Anti-Trumpers are organizing and brigading so they can get around the post limit, and flood the front page. That\\'s why so many non-political redditors have had to filter out like so many subs in the last week. If you guys keep this up, the only things left on reddit will be political posts, because all the non-political users will just leave out of frustration. , A true savior, cheers , Normal people didn\\'t vote for trump. , You mean r/peopleholdingsigns , Yeah they are tankie scum , Funny but also frightening.

Nobody likes Trump! That\\'s why he lost the election! , Seriously, and who the fuck comments in banned from TD to complain that it\\'s anti trump. , No this is definatly brigaded. I have been a part of this sub since the begining and the most any post gets is like 100 upvotes and the posts usually arent blatently anti trump, just anti r/the_donald this brigade honestly makes me sick because it means the jackasses over at r/enoughtrumpspam are going to be posting their shit here now  , yes we all need another enoughtrumpspam clone... I am sure this will grow to be completely different. , And how do you think one of the anti-trump sub clones reaches all? The vast majority of people are aware of what\\'s going on. The shills are pretty clearly doing more harm than good, which is funny. , [deleted] , Each of those subs has a different focus, that isn\\'t to be pro-Trump. The Anti-Trumpers are brigading to create new specifically Anti-Trump subs. The only reason they need more than one Anti-Trump sub is so they can get around the /all post limits. , [deleted] , It\\'s all pretty embarrassing, to be honest. Both sides.

Kinda funny how that upsets you, but the ridiculous echo chamber in the politics sub (where actual discussion is supposed to happen) doesn\\'t. , Do you really think they are unaware how much the rest of Reddit disagrees with them?

How far the inequality would have to go, how blatantly they would have to act against the will of the American people. \\n\\nIt seems we may have found the line.

Under that assumption, there would really be no conspiracy to \"allow\" anti-Trump subs to appear. In fact, that would serve to explain why new ones keep being made (to game the history system).\\n\\n> It\\'s okay for altright to get banned but fuckthealtright somehow is just fine.\\n\\nI don\\'t know exactly what goes on in fuckthealtright, but it seems pretty likely that they aren\\'t guilty of the same crimes that altright was. Altright, for all its hate and Nazism, was allowed to exist for a rather long time, until it *also* started engaging in blatant doxing and crowdsourced bounty-hunting.\\n\\n> Free speech seems to only be free if you hate the president, which falls inline with the agenda of *free speech only applies to people that don\\'t say things that I find offensive*. Might as well just axe free speech from the constitution at this point and put an addendum in there covering trigger warnings and safe spaces.\\n\\nReddit has only ever conformed to the ideal of \"free speech\" by choice. There\\'s literally no legal reason for them to allow any speech they don\\'t like - they\\'re not bound by the constitution at all, in that regard. And even so, they still stand up for it, to really impressive extents! If you think that banning altright is so unconscionable that it means those ideals are irrevocably compromised, let me tell you something - *not even the constitutional implementation of Free Speech is absolute*. [Schenck v. United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenck_v._United_States) established that the right to free speech cannot supersede people\\'s safety, and that legitimately dangerous speech can be prevented by law.\\n\\nNow, I\\'ll reiterate that reddit *is not bound by this*. They have no obligation to uphold the constitution version of Free Speech in the first place, and insofar as they *choose* to do so anyway, they are well within their rights to alter it with whatever additional boundaries that they want. But considering what altright was actually *doing* to earn their ban - organizing to find, harass, and possibly even cause violence to, a specific person - it seems to me like reddit was playing pretty close to the spirit of the constitutional limits on Free Speech anyway. They were acting to eliminate legitimately dangerous speech. , Congratulations, you\\'ve learned the hypocrisy of the Reddit admins, or, as would T_D pedestrians say, \"redpilled\". , Why can almost no one get it through their heads that THERE IS NO FREE SPEECH ON THE INTERNET. Websites and admins can ban you for whatever they want. Just like how free speech doesn\\'t exist on private property. You can throw someone out of your house for saying the wrong thing. , I don\\'t give a fuck about the election but that banning really stood out for me. An apparent hate group gets banned, but a sub that is literally \\'fuck this group of people\\' gets to stay and gets up voted to the front page all the time?  , deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.2444  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/43654) , fuckthealtright doxxes people?\\n\\nYou know altright wasnt banned for their views or the fact they openly worship Hitler, its because they started doxxing people and Reddit admins dont want criminal harassment taking place on their website.\\n\\nr/all algorithm gives preferential weight to smaller subs to give them a chance of reaching r/all rather than it continually dominated by the big defaults (r/pics, r/awww) this was since the algorithm change and the biggest change imo wasnt the increase of some new political subs, it was the influx of porn which with their smaller sub base have found new chances of hitting r/all. It used to never happen and now it happens nearly daily.\\n\\nYou also dont know what free speech entails, at no point was someone jailed from here for what they said by the US government. \\n\\n>**Congress** shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\\n\\nBolded for emphasis. The government cant infringe on your free speech. Any individual company doesnt have to cater to nor support you as a megaphone. Companies who have their bottom line to consider, a company like reddit which is in a way beholden to its advertisers will definitely axe shit that people find offensive/terrible optics to be associated with (jailbait/equivalent subreddits). Its already very lenient, 3rd top post in altright was \"something something for our boys in grey\" which was a picture of a large nazi assembly, what company/advertiser do you reckon wants to be associated with that shit? You think television shows not allowing nudity at 4pm is censorship? No, they dont want to piss off their advertisers when mothers complain their precious saw a testicle on <insert daytime show> or someone said \"fucking spastic\" which hurt their autistic child\\'s feelings. Free speech isnt infringed on here. The government didnt send in some brown shirts because you spoke ill of it. A company punitively fucked over someone for being offensive and it boils down to the bottom line as the reasoning not some safe space bullshit.\\n\\nRest of your shit is rubbish considering I was banned from the_donald for concern trolling when I mentioned that the RNC would be a gun free zone. the_dipshits are the biggest safe space in reddit from an objective standpoint , You do know that the First Amendment protects you from having the government control your free speech, right? Like I can make a website and just allow discussion of the hit classic Hungry Hungry Hippos and I can ban anyone from my website that thinks Hungry Hungry Hippos isn\\'t the best game ever created and that\\'s not impeding anyone\\'s free speech. The Reddit Admins decided people that advocate for racial relocation and genocide aren\\'t fucking welcome on their site, but people that are against that are welcome on their site. That\\'s their right just as much as it\\'s your right to express your opinion. We all have First Amendment rights and as long as the government isn\\'t suppressing it and none of our free speech is causing any harm to other, slanderous, libel, inciting violence, etc, then all our rights are being cared for. I would argue the alt-right was in violation of the First Amendment waaaaay more than the Reddit admins, because they were using hate speech and inciting violence. \\n\\nBut you, me, and the Reddit admins? We are all perfectly in line with the First Amendment.  , fuckthealtright is about 20 times as mild as altright was. Trust me, I went there plenty to observe the insanity. Thousands of people calmly and cogently discussing the best strategy for deleting entire races off the surface of the earth. Talking about genocide like it\\'s tetris. They should have been banned a long time ago. , Strike free speech from the constitution because of something Reddit (a private company) did? Good to see you value the constitution, and free speech.

I wasn\\'t even criticizing it, just commented that I\\'d never heard it before.\\n\\nDespite what many people try to make you believe, being anti-Hilary and pro-Trump are not the same thing. , There\\'s a difference between laughing at stupid people saying stupid things and being pro-trump, you know.  , TiA only makes fun of loonies from Tumblr - the SJW/Otherkin type of people. Almost never gets political. , I\\'m not a Trump supporter, but \"laughing at stupid liberals\" is my guilty pleasure of late. , Spend a few minutes on r/Kotakuinaction or r/Tumblrinaction and you will see those people absolutely deserve to get made fun of. It just so happens they are usually liberals.  , The people there might share similar opinions but the difference between thm and all of these anti-trump subs is that they don\\'t make the sole focus to say something negative about a singular person such as trump  , So you get banned from those places for saying something anti-Trump? , Pray tell, when does TIA have any political posts?  , TiA and KiA are not pro-Trump. It\\'s idiotic to even imply that. They are simply anti-leftist. IGTHFT is not conservative, they just don\\'t have any political sacred cows and rightly find most anti-Trump memes unfunny tryhard political statements with 0 humor. Like it or not, Trump is funny. When your best jokes about him are that he\\'s orange or he has tiny hands (biggest reach ever) or the way he talks, which is now constantly emulated, then you know you\\'re grasping at straws. His hair is the most obvious one and even that\\'s been run into the ground for years. Also, if you weren\\'t retarded and actually paid attention, you\\'d see that /r/conspiracy users are actually fed up with the perceived Trump favoritism there. \\n\\nSo in summary, you\\'re full of shit and have no idea what you\\'re talking about. Like most leftists. , So besides MensRights which is decidedly *not* pro Trump (and on a tangent for a moment, including it really doesn\\'t help your case), I\\'m seeing two news subs that aren\\'t pro-trump, a sub that\\'s an extension of T_D, a bunch of subs that are so small as to be insignificant, and a sub that shows you don\\'t understand the difference between pro-trump and anti-hillary.\\n\\nYou could make the case that *maybe* Conservative or Republican are pro-trump. Maybe. Even they aren\\'t what you\\'d call *pro* Trump. , >KotakuInAction\\n\\n>SRSSucks\\n\\n>Wikileaks\\n\\n>SubredditCancer\\n\\n>Conspiracy\\n\\n>Republicans\\n\\nWew lad\\n\\nPerhaps people would take you more seriously if your list wasn\\'t a bunch of subs that aren\\'t pro-trump and a bunch of subs that nobody has ever heard of. , Lol TheFemPill and Dickgirls are not trump supporting subreddits.

Sick list ya got there bud , Yes, what the media should do is keeps its mouth shut if it is unable to present facts in a way that suits the Trump narrative.\\n  , Wow.  No.  The dishonest trump has been trying to discredit the truth so he can carry on with his shit show while the populous remains oblivious. Come on man.  At some point you HAVE to see the reality here.  No doubt the media sensationalizes everything and always has, but facts are still facts.  Spicers facts were false and proveably so.  The media didn\\'t even care much about crowd size until thin skinned Donnie did his typical song and dance about his being the best.  It\\'s time to give up and see reality.  The world is laughing at us.  We have a disastrous and clearly confused administration that is in way over it\\'s head.  They\\'re reactionary and clueless.  The agenda is clearly Bannon\\'s, clearly falls in line with his known beliefs, and those beliefs are absolutely frighteningly dillusional.  I\\'m ready to forgive what you folks did as long as we can all agree this is going way worse than anyone anticipated and that we need to fix it.  I\\'m not asking to go far left.  I\\'m just asking that we save our country. , You\\'re right,  but you\\'re passing into a waterfall of stupidity.  They can\\'t see it.  , In this instance fact A presented by the biased sad fake news media was that barely anyone saw the inauguration. Fact B presented by herr minister for propaganda Spicer was that Trump\\'s inauguration had the largest crowd in the history of the US.\\n\\n\\nThese facts contradict one another. The point is that neither of these facts can be trusted, both sides use that to de-legitimize one another. But they are both LYING TO YOU. They present the \"facts\" in a way that furthers their narrative and convinces you to buy into it. , [deleted] , Somebody didn\\'t give Kelly Anne the memo then apparently.

We have also put in place the technology necessary to automatically mine white nationalist message boards and alt-right communities for our archive.\\n\\n...\\n> Cutting-edge advances in cloud computing and machine learning will enable us to identify patterns and connections that would otherwise go under the radar. We will be able to assess where and how misinformation is likely to move, who will be affected by it, **and what needs to be done to neutralize it.**\\n\\n...\\n> Media matters will not just manage the effects of media fragmentation; we will leverage it to advance our mission.\\n\\n\\n> To this end, Media Matters will enhance our existing digital program by establishing an omnichannel communications command center to **communicate with audiences in ways that are optimized for the platform on which they are already most engaged.**\\n\\n...\\n> Our award-winning digital team has incorporated elements of this strategy into our communications for the past few years, resulting in a 970% increase in engagement and a comparable increase in growth.\\n\\n> Now, Media Matters will fully incorporate this approach by overhauling our social media strategy, **adding additional staff to our social media team, and initiating a comprehensive audience targeting and segmentation program.**\\n\\n> We will also bring on board an expert to construct turnkey rapid-response plans so that Media Matters can quash burgeoning online harassment campaigns and fake news **or saturate the landscape with truth, bypassing the news media entirely if need be.**\\n\\n...\\n> **We will train hundreds of thousands of individuals** on how to identify fake news and alt-right smears in their social media networks and equip them with the tools to fight them on their own.\\n\\n\\nI could go on, but you get the picture. , I mean they openly admit it in public it\\'s not exactly a conspiracy theory here.\\n\\nBreaking news on the next conspiracy: Trump to enable teavel ban on 7 muslim countries , [deleted] , I mean, that\\'s how Reddit works.

Yea, a few more thousand would have helped in that system right?  , Actually 65,000,000+ , Hundreds of thousands isn\\'t needed. Just a few admins.  , Yep.  And if t_d made all these bitchy little subs they would be banned.  , Yes... And that should get them banned for intentionally trying to get around the sub limit in reddits algorithm. They need to start grouping and limiting on that.  , Delighting in the suffering of others isn\\'t normal. You should get that checked out. , Genuinely curious: do you believe three million people voted illegally, and exclusively for Hillary? , You are right, and you are part of the problem. 3 million more votes matter less than 80,000. But yea, Trump is the most popular God emperor by far. Keep sucking the jizz out of his dick that he calls alternative facts.  , Oh what, don\\'t believe in your God emperor enough to think he will get 8 years? Probably smart.

Not everyone who read Wikileaks was a Trump supporter. Not everyone who wanted to stop Hillary was a Trump supporter. (One reason Hillary lost, actually, because Sanders supporters really disliked her obvious corruption.) The Mr_Trump sub was created because of a split and mod drama in our community, and was not to try to get around any of reddit\\'s rules.\\n\\nAlso, we were abiding by the rules of reddit at the time. There was no rule against upvoting our own posts. Reddit invented the rule to remove our posts from the front page.\\n\\nNow Anti-Trumpers are creating new subs with the same theme and purpose (Anti-Trump posts) to get around that rule. , I\\'m sure they are real people, just Russian real people , [deleted] , It\\'s a fucking pro trump sub. Your problem is that you don\\'t like Trump. The sub runs itself just fine. It upvotes content it likes. It bans negative trump shit while providing another sub for people to bash trump. You are simply salty he won. Sry get over it   , It probably takes a few business days to go in there. , Possible, but I doubt it. The secret service is pretty good at their job, as are the security agencies looking for this sort of thing 24/7. A president hasn\\'t been shot in 36 years, and it\\'s been 54 years since one was actually killed. It\\'s possible, but it would take someone with serious intelligence and skill. And somebody smart enough to get the opportunity is gonna be smart enough to see that, no matter how mad Trump is, Mike Pence would be worse.  , I for one throw my full support behind any and all assassination attempts on Donald Trump and Steve Bannon\\'s lives. , He should not be assassinated because then his supporters are going to consider him to be a martyr. Instead, he needs to be impeached, and possibly dragged out of office while he\\'s throwing a temper tantrum  like a child. , Or die of old age, he is 70 years old. , I wouldn\\'t put it past the crazy libs to make an attempt  , >I was too dumb to see the thing that was obvious *because* I\\'m so smart.\\n\\nJesus Christ I can\\'t even imagine what it\\'s like being this delusional , [deleted] , The age-parents-related portion of it , Have you ever heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise? , 🍆 , I had them filtered already thankfully  , Those spikes are probably do to hitting r/all , > If you look at the growth charts of the new anti-Trump subs, it is not organic\\n\\nWhat the hell are you talking about ?\\n\\nTrump is fucking up royally as President and getting more and more unpopular by the day. He is also galvanising and enraging the opposition with his continued divisive politics.\\n , R/T_D itself has periods of huge spikes. If you\\'re going to argue that the spikes aren\\'t organic, I ask you to also call out that sub. \\n\\nBut you won\\'t. Because that\\'s against the narrative you\\'re trying to build.  , I think you\\'re far overestimating the amount of coordination that goes on.  , Normal people dislike both sides. Especially now that all this anti trump is bombarding Reddit. It\\'s more spam and shit than td ever had.  , That\\'s cuz T_D swarms the top posts.  But he\\'s probably right and that\\'s why you usually see so much anti Trump content rise to the top.  There\\'s just a lot of controversial things to get angry about with this administration. , > We\\'re in an anti trump sub and you are getting downvoted.. \\n\\nthat\\'s weird, since I\\'m sitting at 11 upvotes to your 3 upvotes\\n\\n>yeah I got a feeling your wrong and this bullshit hits the front cause mod manipulation. \\n\\nyeah, I got a feeling I\\'m not going to put much stock in the conspiracy theory of a person who doesn\\'t know the difference between \"your\" and \"you\\'re\".\\n\\n>We all know Reddits mods are mostly dems who hate trump.\\n\\nmost of the human species hates trump , >implying you trumptards keep your cuck fetish contained to T_D , \"Reeeeeeee\" , I personally get my checks straight from King Salman\\'s private office. , [deleted] , Let\\'s just look at the number of subscribers on non default pro trump subs compared to non default anti trump.  , Why does it matter how many anti-trump subreddits there are?  What difference does it make to your political opinion?  \\n  \\nFree speech, buddy.  It works both ways. , We don\\'t care that it\\'s anti-Trump. It\\'s just excessive that anti-Trumpers are creating so many new subs so they can spam /all. We need someone to write a script to automatically filter out every new anti-Trump sub. , Two different points being made, buddy.  , /r/trumpgret is pretty hilarious if you haven\\'t seen it , A lot of people are upset.  Anyone can make a subreddit. I don\\'t know why this is surprising to you... , Are you really this stupid and/or ignorant ?\\n\\nANYONE. CAN. CREATE. SUBREDDITS.\\n\\nStop acting like this is some conspiracy when the process clearly starts with one person creating a sub, posting a few anti-Trump posts which are popular and suddenly it grows enough to be featured on /r/all. , So now we\\'re moving the goalposts to \"I wouldn\\'t be surprised if..\"\\n\\nConsidering the content of t_D I\\'m not altogether surprised, particularly now that altright has decided that their new home would be t_D. (If you don\\'t believe me it was on their voat the day they got banned)\\n\\nThat\\'s a far cry from what you said. But it was a great unsubstantiated claim while it lasted! , I\\'m sure from an outsiders perspective it\\'s completely ridiculous haha.  , No,but the idea of creating a new sub just to spam the same things should be taken a bit more seriously. , They literally changed the algorithm due to t_d, so yeah in a way , The difference is t_d never changes subs. You filter em out once and they\\'re out. Mr_Trump was the result of an internal division over moderation, not an attempt to add another spam point. ALL the other subs listed are anti-Trump or occasionally completely unrelated (/r/libertarian).\\n\\nEnoughtrumpspam are basically making new subreddits weekly to get around people\\'s filters, which is much different. They should absolutely be banned. They can have one spammy sub like t_d, the admins allowing them to do otherwise is inviting escalation, which I\\'m sure nobody wants. If t_d started spamming new subs the way ets, everyone loses.\\n\\nIf people want to filter out political subs they should be able to. , the point isn\\'t to stop people from creating subs. ETS isn\\'t trying to create new, original takes on the Trump presidency. They\\'re just trying to get around /all\\'s post limit.\\n\\nNot sure exactly how to solve it, but it\\'s clearly antagonistic toward people who would like to filter it out. , Look at the growth charts. Large inorganic boosts along with other subs in the last few days.\\n\\nhttp://redditmetrics.com/r/Fuckthealtright\\n\\nhttp://redditmetrics.com/r/MarchAgainstTrump\\n\\nhttp://redditmetrics.com/r/Trumpgret\\n\\nhttp://redditmetrics.com/r/TrumpForPrison\\n\\nhttp://redditmetrics.com/r/OurPresident\\n\\nhttp://redditmetrics.com/r/BannedFromThe_Donald , [/r/news is an anti Trump echo chamber.](http://imgur.com/k1f3zD5.jpg) To their credit they did restore it later. , [deleted] , Yeah, but he\\'s fucking up the entire world\\'s politics, thus it\\'s world news. , [deleted] , Snowflakes and their safe spaces.

Curse you Jefferson!! , K that one hurt  , You are a couple of talking points behind. It\\'s not Russia anymore. Now it\\'s Bannon that is pulling the strings.   , Not everyone, but those in this sub are more likely to be.  , It is known  , Didn\\'t the other founder who hung himself declare that this was a pro-free speech site? , Eh those are quite different then the Donald. Coontown was a bunch of racists fucks who took it to far when they started calling for action. Fat people hate was fine until they got sick of the claims of harassment and instead of monitoring their posting a little more they decided to go full harassment and post pictures of obese imgur employees who blocked them. When confronted began doing the same to users and Reddit admins they could get pictures of. So very different than the Donald and different from free speech. , I saw this bot setting fires at Berkeley. beep boop bop , R/pic was started as well with a no political posts rule specifically to counter what the other was doing. Seems to be pretty active. , Right, because getting banned from an internet forum is the same as wrecking a college campus.  , I read that, but I was hoping I could get a few more celebrity opinions to reinforce my bias , If they *are* a Nazi first.* , You just assumed he doesn\\'t like a Hillary supporter.

Haha , [deleted] , [deleted] , You\\'re doing god\\'s work son. , Just trollin a bit lol. But in all seriousness do you get that people like me dont really care about trump? Its a game, we voted for him cause hes funny , Hahah.  You miserable sad fuck.  What happened to you man. , >A US-based site does not mean it has an exclusive US audience\\n\\nI never said that. I said that a US-based site might be skewed more towards US-based news. Politics and Trump in general aren\\'t even a currently US-only deal. LOTS of countries are talking about how their futures will unfold with regards to Trump. That\\'s why Trump and his team are constant news, even in other countries.\\n\\nI agree that it\\'s a spamfest on both sides, but it\\'s what the people are upvoting and LOTS of people feel like it\\'s important enough of a topic to keep talking about. \\n\\nYou have the tools to strip all these subs from your /r/all. Why not do it? , I bet you\\'d be ok with a bakery being sued to force them to bake a cake for a gay couple, despite them being privately owned and against their religion. Constitutional protections only go one way with the left , You realized they literally changed the algorithm targeting TD right? , Lol except the Donald is full of racists pretending they like black people , I\\'m ready to herd all the libs into concentration camps like their hero Roosevelt did in 1941 with Japanese American citizens. , Why can almost no one get it through their heads that THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONCEPT OF FREE SPEECH AND THE LEGAL RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH.  , [deleted] , Not if you\\'re pretty much exclusively laughing about \"stupid\" anti-Trump people, some of which aren\\'t even actually stupid but are merely perceived so because the circlejerk completely misinterprets their statements.  , There is, and you\\'d think those subreddits would adhere quite strongly to that concept as a philosophical basis for all decision-making. They don\\'t. They\\'re very partisan subs these days. Almost like how /r/LateStageCapitalism is actually /r/SocialismButWithASnarkyName now. , /r/conspiracy is definitely pro trump\\n\\nRandom youtube blog of someone calling Hillary and most Democrats a pedophile = plausible enough\\n\\nFBI backed document linking Trump as a Russian stooge = unverified source, promptly deleted.\\n\\nNot allowed any Trump based conspiracy.

Your entire platform is based on a god damn logical fallacy that makes it easier to drink your own koolaid. , Yeah, mainly because its hard to argue with Trump supporters on reddit , 👍 , Wait so are you saying you\\'re a member of the alt-right? Why would you think I\\'d be sympathetic to a racist piece of shit?  , Openly admit what? That they cooperate with federal inquisitions? Yeah, that\\'s real surprising. \\n\\nBreaking news: Donald Trump is definitely not a racist, despite most Muslim countries being banned and building a wall so Mexicans won\\'t come in. \\n\\nActions speak louder than words , [deleted] , T_Dumbass singlehandedly ruined Reddit for a while. I wish I were a trillionaire so I could buy Twitter and ban that orange Russian puppet traitor from using it. I\\'m sorry, I know how you spineless shits get when people talk to you the way you talk to other people. \"Wah! Look at the tolerant left! We\\'re so persecuted! Look at  Milo!\" Even if this sub was manipulating algorithms, it\\'s not like you guys didn\\'t do that for fucking months.

It must be people astroturfing and coordinating attacks on us, that\\'s the only possible scenario! , Based on the premise of this site, those spikes could easily correspond to ban purges happening on T_D. , Have you guys really convinced yourself that anyone critical of Trump on this site is a fucking paid shill?\\n\\nHe lost the popular vote! He\\'s deeply unpopular! And that\\'s just in the US. The rest of the world has an even worse opinion of him!\\n\\nPeople are fucking tired of seeing r/The_Delusional on the front page spouting hateful bullshit and circlejerking themselves over everything their god emperor does. And their fucking tired of them playing the goddamn victim all the time. You fucking people can\\'t take criticism, just like your thin skinned daddy. So you\\'ve taken criticism and and dissenting voices and turned them into \"FAKE NEWS\" or you claim it\\'s just the international illuminati conspiracy lead by Hillary Clintons left tit, and (((Soros))). You blame CTR or now shareblue, because you can\\'t accept that a LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY HATE DONALD TRUMP. , They just dont like it when it swings against them. Funny how they apparently need safe spaces and need to point out of the system is \"rigged\" against them.\\n\\nIts kind of amusing to watch. , Oh, I guess that explains why Hillary is president! , [removed] , Look at PA, WI, and MI. Close races, a couple hundred thousand votes in those states and she could have won. Popular vote doesn\\'t matter though, sorry you haven\\'t grasped that yet , You guys deserve it. Everything you have done before, during the election and what you are doing now oh baby it\\'s sweet to see the tantrums and tears ( and riots and protests and marches lol). Glad to see the suffering of moronic liberals. Gimme more.  , Possibly. We know the democratic party has a set system in place to manipulate the system. The veritas project video here https://youtu.be/hDc8PVCvfKs (TLDW essentially democratic party behind the scenes guys talking about how people are bussed in to vote illegally, car rentals etc ways that they cheat the system voting wise) seems to suggest they WOULD but you would think they would have pushed hard enough during crunchtime to get her elected but then again everyone underestimated trumps chances and maybe her team did too outside of her public disregard for trump winning. , No.  I believe 10 million did,  and only 99 percent of them voted for Hillary. The other 1 percent couldn\\'t read and screwed it up. \\n\\nVotes were run 5 or 6 times in Michigan. Double registrations,  dead voters etc more then make-up for it.  But it doesn\\'t matter.  He would have won the popular too if he wanted.  , K , He\\'ll have fixed everything In Two.  Cuck.   , It\\'s better than making 45 subreddits complaining about something. It\\'s a bunch of biased, whiny opinions and lies usually. I\\'m not obligated to read it, just like you are free to filter the donald if you want to.\\n\\nThere is 1 pro trump subreddit and 150 anti trump subreddits. I\\'d rather ignore something i don\\'t care for, instead of expecting everyone to get rid of something just to fit my preferences. , lol no , The predictability of you being literally too stupid to understand that the premise of the sub is that getting banned from t_d is a good thing.\\n\\nI honestly believe that you\\'re too dumb, for real, to get that. , You realize that you are triggered, right? , > lies?  , I\\'m not crying conspiracy I\\'m saying that the algorithm favors fucking smaller subreddits.  , Few people probably do, but I doubt theres significant number of them. , [deleted] , I thought it was because they were brigading and abusing use of stickies. Behave in poor faith as a community and you get put into time out.\\n\\nSeems pretty simple.  If you see another sub abusing features the same way, tell the admins. , Really what sub has been censored? Can you answer that cuck? No, you can\\'t because you\\'re a lying cuck! Fuck off back to your safe space snowflake.  , [deleted] , That\\'s true, you\\'re right  , The disabled reporter is a whole other issue. That reporter incident was incredibly vile. Im not defending that now and I won\\'t ever defend that. \\n\\nBut back to the looks thing,  does it matter who did it first? You\\'re either above it or you\\'re not lol.    no snowflake, just having some discussion. Much love brother , I think he assumed your age because \\'your\\'. , [deleted] , True that. Conway is even mostly a running joke in T_D, people don\\'t seem to get that though haha , It\\'s very possible, but I doubt it. \\n\\nStuff gets on the front page, the people who don\\'t comment see it and upvote it, it snowballs. believe it or not, there are LOADS of people who come to reddit and never comment.\\n\\nIt could be bots, but it would be an impressively terrible idea because that\\'s not very subtle and would result in some fun bans.\\n\\nIf it IS bots, report it. The mods/admins will look into it.\\n\\nEdit: hell, at this point it\\'s at 20.3k points with 64% upvoting. That means that with upvotes AND downvotes, it\\'s had like 33k votes in 9 hours. If people are trying to bot it, I would imagine it\\'s going both ways. , Yeah, you\\'re right. Hillary hasn\\'t been getting it from Bill for decades. , Based on lead causing brain damage, and you having brain damage. , There is complexity to speech which isn\\'t reflected in barked out labels. , Alternative Facts!!!!! /s , 1) sure you are\\n\\n2) chicken shit? There you go with your middle school bullying again\\n\\n3) see #2\\n\\nThanks for the wiki link, but again see #2 , Well my observations of this is, what is actually causing it (not what they intended), is that from making you think in shades of grey (from white to black). You now just think in either black or white. \\n\\nIt becomes impossible to be neutral or inbetween, or slightly on one side. If you slightly support Trump, you are being name called and you aren\\'t taken serious. And thus Trump supporters take you serious and won\\'t insult you. Forcing you to be even a more Trump supporter. And if you dislike Trump, the people around you push you more and more to see him as the most evil thing out there. \\n\\nPersonally I think this does favor in the direction of Trump. Since anti-trump side is becoming less and less relatable, and if you talk about this, you will be ridiculed and then you get the original issue again. So it doesn\\'t only destroy the shades of thinking to force 2 options, but it also destroys the balance, putting way more on 1 side. And we know what happens if you just have one way of thinking be popular, you get echo chambers, and you start making horrible decisions. \\n\\nHowever what happens here on Reddit is a reaction to what Trump is doing, so it\\'s not 100% the fault of one of the 2. Both sides are at fault. Though Trump does it in another way, he uses his position/persuasion/twitter and patriotism, to force less shades. Now as a reaction the other side does the same, and they indeed gain more traction and support, but I think Trump gains way more. Trump\\'s gains aren\\'t the loudest, but the quiet. \\n\\nSo this actually might be all Trumps doing (on purpose or completely by accident), he lays a hook and bait. And everyone goes and bites it, they can\\'t beat him, and end up overcompensating, and pushing away a lot of people, but they are also gaining dedicated people, so they don\\'t realize it. Short term goals vs Long term goals. \\n\\n , no wonder youre so ignorant on the reality of what\\'s actually going on then...\\n\\nyou probably think the Berkeley riot was an altright false flag dont you?  probably dont even know that the 90 day ban was based on a list of countries obama made lol\\n\\nuncuck yourself friend , You also post in /r/food and /r/PS4 .... pretty sure you are the wrong type of diabetic.  , And they also added fingerprint registers to the vetting process. There was no attack in the US, no IEDs in the US and no one in the US was killed or even hurt. It was a case of our vetting process finding a flaw and fixing it. There was a slow down in admitting refugees but no ban. \\n\\nThe fact that you are still trying to justify this is, frankly, fucking astounding. , No not really. I wanted to go to New York (I\\'m in Toronto) and march with all the women, but was informed that Canadians should not get involved in marches in other countries. Kinda dangerous. So I went to Toronto city hall and marched there. \\n\\nI also got a nice mouthful of tear gas during the G20 summit here.

And then they start whinging when their vote manipulation gets a post to all and then we all see it and just downvote the latest silly bollocks that has escaped the funny farm, accusing Reddit of \\'brigading\\' them. Nope, not brigading, just a majority of users downvoting rubbish. Or democracy if you like, comrade. , How do you like your job at the troll farm?  , I disagree. Pence is predictable shitty. Trump is irrationally unpredictable shitty. One is far worse than the other, to me.  , Does shoe throwing count as assassination attempt? , >\"The secret service is pretty good at their job\"\\n\\nTheir success rate at stopping assassination attempts is very low: 8/45 presidents (18%) have died in office, half of which were successful assassinations. Check out [the list](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_assassination_attempts_and_plots?wprov=sfla1), most of the failed attempts were down to the assassin making a mistake, not the Secret Service.\\n\\nFor example, John Hinckley, Jr. successfully shot Reagan but failed to kill him and Vladimir Arutyunian\\xa0threw a live hand grenade at Bush that didn\\'t go off because the hammer jammed.\\n\\nIf someone is determined to kill Trump, there\\'s not much the Secret Service can do except wait for it to happen and hope the assassin misses. , It wouldn\\'t really be that hard at all to kill the POTUS. When you think about \"then why hasn\\'t anyone done it yet?\" It\\'s important to note that only a minuscule portion of the population would actually consider killing the president and of that portion, most would be discouraged by the security theatre. The secret service are good at their job but their job would also be an impossible task if everyone who hates Trump would actually consider assassinating him. The biggest defence against assassinations is the theatre of security: making sure everyone know\\'s he\\'s well protected. He could be just as well protected but by people and processes that are not obvious, and a lot more attempts would happen. People don\\'t try because they assume it\\'s impossible and don\\'t want to find out. Yes the secret service are essential for protecting the POTUS, but it will always be possible to assassinate a president. The west is in a very complacent state this century, atrocities happen and we protest maybe a couple of times and then we forget about it.

A sub that is just created without being linked all over reddit reaching the front of r/all is suspicious, while r/the_donald is seen as THE sub for Donald supporters. I see that reasoning being uhmm... reasonable? \\n\\nDisclaimer: I consider myself nuetral and browse both sides. And I don\\'t necessarily think it\\'s true. , Maybe it\\'s not spam. .. and people actually hate the guy and everything he stands for? , Hahaha enjoy the next 8 years princess. , I don\\'t like Trump at all, all you fuckers on both sides have gotten annoying as shit. But I filtered the_donald and I haven\\'t heard a positive thing about him in months. I have a dozen anti-Trump subs filtered and you annoying fucks just keep making more and polluting defaults.  , Lmao then you literally are the embodiment of that, hot guy.  , ~~\"...excessive...\"~~  \\n  \\nfree speech  \\n  \\nFTFY , republican arguing 101 , Try to see it from the other perspective. Wouldn\\'t you be concerned if T_D users flooded 5 new subreddits in a single weekend to get around the /all post limit? \\n\\nHonestly, it\\'s not my problem, because I don\\'t actually visit /all. If you guys want to drive away all non-political users from this site, then go for it. I\\'m just trying to explain what is happening to those users. , > No,but the idea of creating a new sub just to spam the same things *that I don\\'t agree with* should be taken a bit more seriously.\\n\\nFTFY\\n , Just had an idea... What if there was a sub \"category\" system? You could filter out the \"politics\" or \"leftist\" or \"conservative\" category. If enough people vote for something to go into a category, it enters that category. So then all the new ETS spam subs would end up in a political category. Normal users could filter out politics. And problem solved. , Good find. That is...interesting to say the least.\\n , don\\'t their mods delete pro-Trump posts? , > anti trump subs ~~are going to jump~~ have jumped the shark \\n\\nFTFY\\n\\n , > Yeah, an enforced echo chamber for the US president is kinda creepy.\\n\\nReally?\\n\\n/r/politics would like to have a word with you. , Yeah I see what you\\'re saying. However, that sub has been a pro Trump rally for over a year as far as I know. That\\'s all they\\'ve been doing. They\\'re not really a \"political discussion\" sub as much as they are a fan club sub I guess you can say. The real political discussion sub are the two I mentioned I\\'m another comment , Good to know you\\'d rather fling insults rather than have a meaningful discussion. , Your last comment made it seem like you wanted \"actual discussion\" , What you want is to create an echo chamber for the other side.  , you sound kinda hot 😏😚 , [deleted] , >dailymail \\n\\nHmm , Hey bro want a brojob?

At the same time though you can\\'t expect to vote in an inflammatory and divisive president without a bit of backlash. If you are confident and strong in your beliefs then you shouldn\\'t let this affect you really. If Hillary had got in I\\'m sure Trump supporters would still have plenty of things to say about Hillary supporters. , That\\'s very bigoted and fascist of you. , In your mind the world must be as simple as an abacus. If you think they didn\\'t affect you, then you just have no idea what affects you, or perhaps you\\'re hazy on what \\'affect\\' means.  , You\\'re a retard , Oh I voted. Not for old Trumpy boy or that Dried up cunt Shillary either. I\\'m looking for real change. Not corrupt celebrity in the pockets of everyone sucking on that wall street dick change. No I\\'m talking about real change. Let\\'s burn the whole fucking thing down. Trump just wants to give you that illusion. Good luck having your life continue to suck. , OH BOYYYY WEEEWWWW! I\\'M COMIN FOR YA BOY! WEW , None of what you just said in any way makes me amend what I\\'ve said previously. , I\\'m an actual American that works a job and has to support and raise a family here. \"Trump supporters\" are pieces of hateful shit that want to fucking destroy our country and send our kids to die in order to line the 1%rs pockets. You dumb, stupid son of a bitch willingly let yourself get conned by the most obvious con man and doomed our future in the process. I hope you get everything you deserve. , > You have the tools to strip all these subs from your /r/all. Why not do it?\\n\\nBecause Reddit took a stance on pro-Trump spam and reduced it, now it is required for them to do for the opposite with same tactics side. If they didn\\'t do it, I wouldn\\'t care and just filter it (which I already do because it\\'s rendering r/all unusable) , No correlation  , Just because they were targeting the Donald from an abstract standpoint doesn\\'t mean the code literally says \"if(post.subreddit==\\'The_Donald\\') then post.ApplyDownvotes(100000)\" now. There are smarter, *fairer*, more robust ways to ensure the same desired outcome. , [Citation needed]\\n\\nOr did you pull that from your headspace alternate reality you just imagined , Everyone I don\\'t like is racist: political discourse for democrats , I think you should get on an alt account and go hangout on the Donald for a week to find out how wrong you are. You don\\'t get to call everyone you don\\'t like a racist, however shocking that may be. I have never not one time seen even a lick of racism on the Donald and if there ever was, that person would be banned so quickly it\\'s not even funny. Now, altright? Maybe. But they\\'re a different story. In the same way the \"altright\" don\\'t represent Trump voters as a whole, antifa and violent Berkeley idiots don\\'t represent liberals as a whole. You have to stop with the racism accusations. It\\'s stupid, petty, it\\'s not even true, and if you want to politically manipulate people on the internet to align with your beliefs, you need to be more suave about it. Because this calling everyone you don\\'t agree with a racist Hitler is going to go downhill for you real fast, real soon. , Too soon? , And that you aren\\'t free of the consequences of free speech , The first sub you linked seems pretty alright\\n\\n^^^^^youmadeatypo , > if you\\'re pretty much exclusively laughing about \"stupid\" anti-Trump people\\n\\n...have you ever actually *been* to KiA or TiA? , LateStageCapitalism has always been \"CommunismUberAlles\" though. , Is it also possible the pro-Trump subs just aren\\'t as popular as anti-Trump subs, and half the reason /r/T_D makes it to the front of /r/all so often is because people just like witnessing the insanity of /r/T_D , It was. , [deleted] , [deleted] , \"ACTIONS OF FEW INDIVIDUALS DON\\'T MEAN THAT EVERYONE FROM THE GROUP IS LIKE THAT\" Seems familiar? Isn\\'t that what everyone parrot in MSM and twitter after yet another muslim terrorist attack? And yet here you are, putting everyone from a different political group into one basket because of actions of few individuals. **SO TOLERANT** , it must hard having to say that a lot! how often do you think you have to make that clarification?\\n\\nSorry its just very interesting to me since I\\'ve never had a political view that could potential rope myself in w neo nazsi, fascists, jingoists, bigots, or racists. \\n\\nIt must be hard....having to explain how you arent a racist biggotted homophobic islamophobe and you are just someone who  got swindled by a snakeoil salesman. \\n\\n , [deleted] , The media has been labeling anyone who disagrees as alt-right, and it seems they have successfully muddied the waters. I\\'m not a member of any political advocacy group, nor do i consider myself as being on the \"right\".\\n\\nMedia Matters basically wants to decide on your behalf what is true and what isn\\'t. Do you really trust that they have your best interests in mind? Their whole shtick is to foment hysteria to provoke people into behaving as you are now, attempting to bypass reason in favor of shaming tactics. But by all means, let them saturate your mind with \"truth\".\\n , ...they openly admit to buying bots and people to spam social media and small time media outlets with what used to be \"over the top\" accusations in order to normalize demonizing Trump, or any republican, and/or supporters. \\n\\nYou aren\\'t very good with sarcasm or general intelligence I see. Unlucky , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_by_country\\n\\nI counted over 50 countries with majority Muslim populations. Seven are banned. Among those not banned are the 5 countries with the most Muslims.\\n\\nMexico is the Country that happens to be along the southern border of the USA, and is also the Country where millions and millions of illegal immigrants come from.

Holy shit you can\\'t even see your hypocrisy.  , -slow blink- , I actually don\\'t care, though it\\'s funny that you think I do. In general, I only visit T_D, as my post history will show. If you want to turn the front page of your website into constant political garbage, it\\'s not my problem, lol. , T_D\\'s bannings are constant, though, and never that many in one day. , > Have you guys really convinced yourself that anyone critical of Trump on this site is a fucking paid shill?\\n\\nOf course there are people who aren\\'t paid shills. But I think there\\'s a difference between disagreeing with Trump, and organizing to create new subs to get around reddit\\'s new /all algorithm.\\n\\n>He lost the popular vote! He\\'s deeply unpopular! And that\\'s just in the US. \\n\\nActually, he might not have lost the popular vote. We\\'ll see after we investigate the massive voter fraud in California.\\n\\n>The rest of the world has an even worse opinion of him!\\n\\nI know. That\\'s one of the biggest reasons I voted for him. I want a president who puts American interests first. Time to cut off the gravy train of free stuff for foreigners.\\n\\n>People are fucking tired of seeing r/The_Delusional on the front page spouting hateful bullshit and circlejerking themselves over everything their god emperor does.\\n\\nThat\\'s what the filter is for, though? Literally, you can go to the front page right now, type 10 characters and click once, and you will never see T_D posts ever again.\\n\\nYou would rather spend a bunch of time organizing to create new subs to spam the front page with anti-Trump stuff? Seems like that\\'s more time consuming than just filtering T_D, but you do you, I guess.\\n\\n>You fucking people can\\'t take criticism, just like your thin skinned daddy.\\n\\nI answered your criticism just now. I don\\'t think I\\'m reacting as hard to this as you are, judging by the number of caps and cuss words and ad hominems each of us are using.\\n\\n> So you\\'ve taken criticism and and dissenting voices and turned them into \"FAKE NEWS\" or you claim it\\'s just the international illuminati conspiracy lead by Hillary Clintons left tit, and (((Soros))). You blame CTR or now shareblue, because you can\\'t accept that a LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY HATE DONALD TRUMP.\\n\\nI realize a lot of people strongly dislike Trump. But I don\\'t think that makes it okay for reddit to apply the rules unequally. T_D is not allowed to brigade many subs to bypass /all\\'s rules. I don\\'t think Anti-Trumpers should be, either. , it\\'s not about how many you have, it\\'s about their distribution.  , Those voters had no bearing as to my anal activities.  , Wait, what did we do, exactly?

I mean with that cabinet of his, surely victory is the only possible outcome. Speaking of victory, what is he replacing the ACA with? Also, tax returns? And inside deals with Wallstreet? And allowing churches to donate freely to political parties? And Twitter lies? And his ridiculously paper-thin skin? I mean I could keep on going but please, tell me more about how successful he is. I love to hear more about the failure, disaster and embarrassment of the man leading our country. \\n\\nEdit: Cuck , Keep fighting that fight!

RREEEEEEEEEEEEE , Damn you\\'re triggered.  Do you need a tissue? , Expecting the left to be above anything when their own president is against them(see his tweets mentioning \"cuck/lib/left tears\"(i dont remember exactly) is naive. The right is using everything from looks, to religion to handicaps to push their own agenda and there is only one way to fight that in a desperate situation. \\n\\nTo be quite honest trumps supporters are worse than trump himself(for now), and thats what is so worrying for everyone.  , Its exactly what happened, there is nothing to doubt. Theres no possible way a post from this sub can reach /all when every other post on this sub cant even reach 100 upvotes, (you cant reach all with 100 votes) This sub isnt active enough...... if a post cant reach /all it doesnt get to benefit from the anti Trump libtard snowball effect youre talking about.... an upvote bot was used to get this to /all, (only 1-2k needed) which then snowballed to the top since reddit is an anti-Trump circle jerk..... , I have brain damage for simply stating that all politicians lie and that lies in politics aren\\'t new or horrifying?

Your smartass joke was so funny. , All bullshit aside, if you are a sub then technically you have the more dominant stance in the relationship with your dom because in that situation you are the one that draws the line and helps to establish exactly which lines are not to be crossed. \\n\\nTo submit is to control. \\n\\n Bruh.  , [deleted] , Yes , And you\\'re a fucking idiot.\\n\\nDo you even know what Liberal means?  , Well stop masturbating then, mister darwinist  , Jacking it on traps doesn\\'t seem fun either but we don\\'t see you complaining. , Weird thing is I don\\'t remember anyone asking for your judgements on an individual\\'s sexual preferences. , Me neither,  but I can imagine some people enjoying it , Lol why?

He expanded the NSAs spying capabilities of our own people.

No argument in that. However there\\'s a sub for that. There\\'s probably multiple and many subs specifically called I hate trump. The multitude of others is just propaganda and spam. This is proven by the new subs created daily with a new slogan that somehow hits r/all or popular with minimal subscribers \\n\\nI don\\'t even know what we\\'re taking about anymore it\\'s been so long lol  , I\\'m up here in canada, so this is pure entertainment for me.

In a way, the anti-Trumpers are doing our work for us. They\\'re purposely trying to get around your filters. And in real life, they\\'re violently suppressing conservatives and libertarians (see the riots and violence at UC Berkeley the other night). At this rate, sane people will vote for Trump just to send a message to the anti-free speech leftists. , I mean, if trump supporters did it to I think he would support the same thing. Fuck, I voted Hillary and don\\'t like Trump, and I think it\\'s annoying as fuck. Why do we need 1,000 anti trump subreddits? Especially when they all do the same thing, and their purpose just seems to be to get 1-2 posts to the top of r/all before people filter them and move on.\\n\\nThe admins talk about how they didn\\'t like where things were going with the_donald and shit, and what was happening to reddit, and yet they also the same shit from the other side.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to open r/all to a bunch of shitty, no effort, not funny political circlejerk posts. I don\\'t care if it\\'s Trump supporters, anti Trump people, Hillary people, Bernie people, who the ever. Why do I need to add new subs to my filter every few days for a bunch of new subs that all cover the same shit?\\n\\nIt\\'s the same group of 12 year olds just jerking each other off over and over. At least the admins contained the TS\\'s. But how about the other side? , [deleted] , I do. And I want it to be discussed right at the source, not on an unrelated post in a separate subreddit. Some of the posts on the_Donald are needlessly cocky because they know that whatever they say won\\'t be challenged as long as it\\'s pro-Trump. This is just one way to combat that.\\n\\nTo be clear, Trump supporters can comment on posts in /r/TDuncensored too, they won\\'t be banned.  , Difference is I don\\'t ban those with dissenting views. , You got no idea.  , Actually, I\\'m not. Reddit has me at -1 and declining. , That doesn\\'t sound gay! No homo right?  , Thank you. , I guess I was thinking of Aaron Shultz. , I didn\\'t actually.

Maybe you should look through a different lens at the situation.  , Yes, I am unapologetically intolerant of the \"refugees fend for themselves\" crowd.

Your a \"actually American\". What am I then?  Just a guy who has a job I guess, who also voted, exercising my freedom of speech. But keep thinking of me as a terrible fat retard if it makes you feel better.  And a nazi trump Hitler zombie, I hate Mexicans and I shoot innocent Muslim 5 year old girls with my AR-15.  , Uh, no man. You can filter any sub, not just pro-Trump subs. Filter all the anti-Trump ones.Who cares?\\n\\nReddit changed the algorithm because the users were complaining about one sub gaming the system. They listened to their users and acted, it also helped vary the front page.\\n\\nThen they developed a tool to filter anything you want because their users were still seeing problems. , Only because you believe the private company should be forced to do what you believe to be right.  , That\\'s not what I\\'m talking about though. And if you look at my post history I was consistent in saying that there is most likely a weighting factor in their algorithm for bigger subreddits so they don\\'t dominate /r/all back when TD was the only thing on there for like 30 min or so. \\n\\n\\nI\\'m talking about them literally saying they\\'ve changed it so that sticky posts from that sub alone will no longer be on /r/all. Which is, as I said, literally changing the algorithm to affect TD. \\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n , How about you triggered Donald cucks just stay in your safe space?  , [deleted] , Probably taken from actual reality where Trump and the white house justified their travel ban by saying a Muslim had carried out a terrorist attack in Canada when it was actually a Trump supporter or when the White House removed white supremacists from being on the FBI terrorist list during black history month or it could be how Kellyann Conartist made up a fake terrorist attack to justify her stupidity. So pick one or all. Doesn\\'t matter. He\\'s xenophobic. That\\'s the reality. Deal with it.  , If you\\'re trying to \"red pill\" me it\\'s not going to work. I browse the Donald every single day and even read most of the comments on the top posts. I do this because I like to stay somewhere in the middle between liberalism and conservativism. I\\'ve definitely seen some racist comments on there, though more buried than the easy to see top comments. Literally one said send \"Michelle Obama back to Africa with the rest of the apes\" or something except they called her Michael cuz they think it\\'s funny to call her a man even though she\\'s a beautiful woman anyway I digress. I am not a hill shill but I certainly don\\'t agree with the hateful rhetoric of calling liberals \"cucks\" constantly, it gets old and just shows they get off on insulting others.  , Yes, and the poster above you is right. My ban list is at zero and I read the shitty pro trump subreddits just as much as the anti trump ones.  , Admittedly, I only see what manages to get to /r/all, so my perception may be skewed. In most of these threads, however, commenters regularly defend Trump with downright religious zeal and make fun of legitimate concerns over his policies.  , I remember a time when it was just a fun subreddit for mocking outrageous examples of corporatism. Maybe I just wasn\\'t paying close enough attention, though. , the timelapse has a strange cut right at the peak crowd time\\n\\nthe original \\'small crowd\\' photo has no time stamp or way to confirm the time the photo was taken\\n\\nthere are questionable discrepancies between the small crowd photo and the cnn gigapixel photo to indicate that the small crowd photo was not taken at peak crowd size\\n\\nspicer explained why those central regions near the washington monument were less crowded this year\\n\\nSpicer said that the Trump inauguration was the most watched inauguration of all time period.

Bizzare. , The idea of non open relationships come from being together in a relationship on the basis that you want to fuck each other. Open relationships are based on being together because you want to be together. Think about it. The idea \\'you don\\'t love me anymore because someone elses dick was in your mouth\\' is the stupidest thing. If people are too dumb to have sex without causing pregnancy or disease, that\\'s on them, but barring those people there\\'s no reason to base a relationship on sex.

He will renegotiate bad trade deals, and stop sending free money to foreigners. Other countries will have to pay if they want protection from our military.

That really hurts coming from an anonymous source on the Internet... , True. However, most subreddit users are there for information and community not conspiracies and hate speech.

You\\'re thoughts on sex seem to work for you, and that\\'s great, but that\\'s about as far as that information is relevant. , OK but you use \"I\" and \"me\"s in your little rant, and then claim everyone should be more like you. The point is that everyone is not you and may have different kinks and fetishes in the bedroom. And this isn\\'t even a discussion limited to just sex, gay marriage for instance was held up for years because people wanted other people to live in the same manner that they did. Abortion is a hot topic issue because people want others to live according to their values. The list goes on. Any time you use me or I and then attempt to use it as a baseline for all of humanity to adhere to.. well you only make a fool of yourself.  , Yeah the sub can say stop but the dom can just leave. That one is even and everything else is in the dom\\'s favor. , Good one, You\\'re still a fucking idiot. , I\\'m just making a point. Laughing at people for having a fetish is very, very childish. , I don\\'t have a wife, lol. Playing vidya games is for children. Grow up.  , Right, because you/they are offended by the term--try to keep up. I don\\'t care either way--it\\'s just like calling someone gay: if the person actually is gay or isn\\'t a homophobe, s/he\\'s not going to be insulted by it; it\\'s only an insult to the person saying it seriously as an insult. You said it as an insult, which leads me to believe you take it seriously. Therefore, you are a betacuck. \\n\\nSimilarly, you got offended by me saying that I hate Nazis. I never said you were a Nazi, but apparently that triggered you. In the same way, Nazis get really triggered by being called socialists. I don\\'t care how you personally identify on any given day, you\\'re 99% the same.\\n\\nIt also denotes subservience and reluctant acceptance, which is fitting because you\\'re a huge pussy. If you want to avoid being triggered by mean people on the internet, find some safe space, whether it\\'s r/The_Donald or r/LateStageCapitalism, and stick to it. , Well said , I don\\'t think that most people who are in monogamous relationships think about it this way. For many many people sex is a deep form of affection. I understand that some don\\'t see it that way, but the fact is that for most people, they don\\'t have sex with someone they have no affection for. The idea with monogamy for most people is that you have decided to stop pursuing affection towards other people as a way of saying \"You are special to me, you are the only one I want to be affectionate with.\" \\n\\nThere are also evolutionary pressures which might select for monogamy as well, since sexual relationships have been known to result in children. A child\\'s survival has traditionally meant 15-20 years of investment in their well-being and education. Since it requires such a large investment of time and energy, males who decided to participate in those activities likely increased the likely hood of their offsprings survival. Having large numbers of children with the same female has the added benefit of allowing a male to continue a sexual, offspring bearing relationship with less overall effort. Where as a male who used that time to run off to find multiple mates not only has to spend energy initiating each relationship, but then moves on and does nothing to improve his offsprings chances of survival. In a tribal society where humanity originated from, it would soon become known amongst the females who could be counted on to bear the responsibility of child-rearing and who they should avoid sexual relationships with in order to protect their offspring. , That seems phrased like you think people in open relationships love each other more than monogamists. , Lol, your wife loves you so much she goes out and takes dick from other guys.\\n\\nSay it with me folks, *liberalism is a mental disorder* , To some people, apparently. , Trump doesn\\'t count... , Then you should realize how consent works. \\n\\nBut I know that you dont considering who you voted for , Their economy was 100℅ in the control of the government, I\\'m sorry, have you never had a history lesson?\\n\\nYou can\\'t no-true-scotsman your way out of this , You called denying entry to refugees \"nasty,\" not me. It\\'s not my fault Obama was also \"nasty.\" , Talking in only memes is literally the opposite of creativity. , If we\\'re putting everyone who says he\\'s better off dead on a watchlist, I imagine his wife and closest peers are on it as well. You\\'re welcome to worry about it and cry if you like. He says worse, and with actual lives on the line, on a daily basis. But if you want to peak your little snowflake head out of T_D to cry infringed speech or something - go ahead. No threat was made. And, for now at least, there are still some 1st amendment rights in this country.\\n\\nI\\'m not the guy to do such a thing, since this needs to be spelled out for pedantic trolls like yourself. But if someone else wants to work on such an endeavor - they\\'ve certainly got my blessing. \\n\\n(2nd amendment people I\\'m looking at you) , I\\'m sorry you find your own dumbass declaration so confusing. , [deleted] , [deleted] , > It\\'s great to finally have a president who actually prioritizes the needs of US citizens.\\n\\nyou\\'re still stuck on stage 1, stage 2 is going to be a hilarious to witness  , I see something that isn\\'t a safe space for your delicate sensibilities.

Didn\\'t honestly think of it that way.  , Your so closed minded.  Ever try thinking from a opposing view for once?  You realize your being the hateful one here right? , >They made it free from paid to be exact. \\n\\nFair, like they did with username pings.\\n\\n>But I now see the same problem with gaming the system from the opposite side with a much worse tactic\\n\\nThe problem was people upvoting too much. With one sub like the donald, it was just basically \"if you\\'re in this sub, you upvote everything\". Reddit typically doesn\\'t attract that sort of person as a whole and into every single sub, so t_d were able to get MANY submissions to the front page simply because all their users upvoted everything.\\n\\nThere was and is still some concern of bots, but I don\\'t think it\\'s every been proven, because the sub still exists.\\n\\nThe rest of the users of reddit (99% of the people who use the site) didn\\'t like this because their front pages were constantly flooded by a small percentage of die-hards. \\n\\nTypically the solution would be for everyone else to upvote THEIR content to surpass the donald, but you can\\'t organize millions and millions of people to do that and for long enough where it would matter, and reddit didn\\'t want to lose their users, so how the front page got reached was changed.\\n\\nAfter Trump was elected and inaugurated, you\\'re seeing more and more subs pop up against him. Personally, I think this is because people are objectively against his executive orders, travel bans, and various policies and are voicing their opinions, and it\\'s just becoming more and more a popular opinion that those same people will upvote.\\n\\nI don\\'t **THINK** the anti-trump subs share many of the same mods, but I could be wrong.\\n\\nI don\\'t think there\\'s a \"tactic\" because that implies a sort of coordinated effort? I think this is just users reacting.\\n\\n>with \"filter them if you don\\'t like them\" as an excuse\\n\\nAn excuse for what? It\\'s one of the tools you can use. Anyone can use it. Simply get rid of the things that annoy you.\\n\\n>Why wasn\\'t this the answer for the pro-Trump spam?\\n\\n**It was**. It was given to people when the pro-Trump subs were the spam. , Are they not both private companies? What difference does it make if it\\'s online or brick and mortar?... Not surprising you\\'re all for censorship of dissenting opinions, but the right are the fascists right? All you need to do is look at Berkeley and people getting beaten by poles to know who the dangerous ones are. Also the gay couple weren\\'t denied service, the bakery said they wouldn\\'t make them a wedding cake because they opposed it on religious grounds. They would\\'ve happily sold them anything else.   , Or how about you take your brown shirt state propaganda and fuck off? Alt right Nazi fucks blaming Muslims and Mexicans for your poor life. Sad!    , We are ALL points on this blessed day. , Both sides lie. Or at least present the facts in a leading biased way. ie instead of \"Trump inaugurated\" we get \"small crowds at inauguration of racist\" , But Reddit isn\\'t losing out to a competitor. Y\\'all tried to lay down that threat when they banned fatpeoplehate and voat was empty then as it is now.\\n\\nThe majority simply does not agree with you, and on a site like Reddit, for better or worse, *that\\'s* what matters. , deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4581  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/63925) , [deleted] , I\\'m not sure you\\'re capable of having an argument that\\'s above a grade school level, so I think we\\'re done here  , I\\'m not a \"Trumper\" as you put it, but it was certainly better then electing batshit Hillary.

If they\\'re all these liberal censor-happy whatevers, why not just get rid of the place?\\n\\nAnd man I can tell you from the other side, the admins aren\\'t horribly popular with some of the left, either. Everyone thinks that because T)D still exists, the admins are all right-wing plants pretending to be liberal, or that they\\'re being blackmailed, or some other stupid thing. , Well, since I had to explain the joke to you first, I figured I\\'d put in a last dollop of effort.

Don\\'t forget to take your insulin fatty.  , Good definition? Thanks I\\'m glad my definition passed your liberal seal of approval! I am SO excited that finally, a liberal is not debating the fact that the definition of being liberal is a mentally ill cuck! Bro! Acceptance is the first step to recovery! I am so excited for you! I haven\\'t encountered someone who reached acceptance yet, so I\\'m not sure what to tell you. I\\'d say maybe go see a therapist or something but I\\'m just not sure. Read the Constitution? That seems to work to reinvigorate patriotism in normal people. Hmm.\\n\\nLet me know what you plan to do! This is amazing! A liberal who knows he is a mentally ill cuck! Never thought I\\'d see the day. , Not sure that I\\'ve ever laughed at any cuckolding enthusiasts for real, barring that one guy who wrote on NY Times magazine claiming that being cuckolded is a feminist act. It\\'s just a fun new insult for most people, like how many people use faggot and don\\'t mean it as an anti-gay slur. , Video games are for anyone you sad human being , Hahaha brilliant.\\n\\nThe only one triggered is you mate. \\n\\nEdit: offended 😂 , \"you are special to me, you are the only one I want to have sex with\". Alright but you just defined a sex based relationship. If that\\'s what you want that\\'s fine. The only negative connotations I had were that I don\\'t understand it, if it\\'s what you want who cares what someone other than your partner thinks? Especially since random jerk on the internet like me? You do you yo. , There are good arguments against this view. \\nWatch this, its around 14 mins long. \\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/LJhklPJz9U8 , I think that they define love in a completely different way. One is sex based, one is not. It\\'s up to the individual to figure out what is more important to them. If non sex based sounds like \\'loving each other more\\' then sex based does, you might have found your own answer. Yes, I personally find sex based love to seem a bit silly, but if it works for you, who gives a flying fuck what I think? , So.... All liberals want their sexual partners to have sex in front of them with someone else? I must\\'ve missed that meeting. I\\'ve just been fucking my girlfriend alone this whole time. \\n\\nWhen you generalise like that it makes you look ignorant.  , Not everyone means lust when they say love.\\n\\n\\nObligatory \\'how\\'d this liberal basher get banned from t_d\\' comment. , You sound dumb. Like I understand you may have an unfulfilling life, and commenting hate on reddit somehow fills the emptiness that is your soul. But maybe you could just develop a drug habit and go away. Why do you have to make the world around you unhappy as well. , Well this was mildly amusing for 35 minutes. Your subreddit sucks ads and ass, see you never again.  , You and your tendies don\\'t count , No true scotsman?  Did you just learn that fallacy or something?  All I did was ask for a source that backs up your claims.  It shouldn\\'t be hard if you\\'re as right as you think you are.  You can start with /r/AskHistorians, but you\\'ll be disappointed with what you find. , Talking only in memes you didn\\'t even come up with is worse ;) , One sub where like minded people gather versus 18? Yes, I do think it\\'s inorganic. Especially since ShareBlue does exist. Are you saying it doesn\\'t? Plus I never said everyone is a shill. I never said that. , But I did address everything. Sorry it\\'s not all in one comment. , You want to though.... thats why all of you keep whining/crying to the admins to ban us, admins even censored our sub and changed the algorithm on /all multiple times..... , I\\'m the biggest beta bitch around 😤 , Says the guy who voted for the bigot. , What I care about is the result, before r/all was filled with Trump spam, now it\\'s filled with against Trump spam, if Reddit doesn\\'t see a problem with that and before it was \"small percentage of die-hards\" and now \"just users reacting\", well OK. , That\\'s still denying service. And websites and stores are completely different like I said. If Reddit were right wing based and got rid of all liberal subs I would go to a different website not bitch about it.  , So you chose the latter. Nice! Let\\'s see how that plays out for you. 2018 midterms aren\\'t that far away bucko. Please, for my sake, keep doing what you\\'re doing. You\\'re the best campaigners.  , This is why people don\\'t respect you or the left or your 300 anti trump subs anymore.  No one is capable of having a discussion. No one can present an idea.\\n\\nIt\\'s hilarious how the left accuses Republicans of projecting their wrong doings on others, but when it comes to level headed discussions just scream \"GO BACK TO YOUR SAFE SPACE AT T_D\" because they are clearly triggered their own safe space was invaded. they are the ones that just scream \"racist, sexist, xenophobic, islamophobic\" over and over at every little thing that doesn\\'t align with their view of the world, and those words just lose all meaning.  , RemindMe! 5 years \"But Reddit isn\\'t losing out to a competitor\" , You have desecrated the values you once preached and held dear. You have become what you hate, you\\'re just too blinded by ideology to see. , >I\\'m not going to do the thing I believe in because some else does the thing I believe in but I don\\'t like them\\n\\n?????? , Lol ok bud , http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/attacks/attacks.aspx?Yr=Last30\\n\\nShow me equal stats of christian or other religion terrorist attacks. , So no then? You don\\'t know what it means? lol. , Thanks. Less Creative response, though. Work on that.  , You have a disturbing fascination with injuring assholes.  , Alternative facts? , >People have accused T_D of botting in the past, but if anyone discovered it, I\\'m pretty sure they\\'d be banned. Same for this sub. Same for any sub.\\n\\nHow can you say that with a straight face when reddit is so anti Trump, i refer you back to the admin/mod chat leak where there is virtually no support for Trump or our subs right to free speech. Most of them are calling for a straight ban for no reason...\\n\\n> he said, ignoring that his sub is the very definition of a safespace.\\n\\nI know its a safe space, im not denying. The only place on reddit where i dont have to listen to a liberal whine. Its awesome.\\n\\n> And \"censor\", lol. He changed one word of one comment months ago.\\n\\nWow you think thats all he did, he changed the algorithm several times to prevent us from reaching /all, constantly threatened our sub of getting banned (extremely stressful during election), reddit admins even enforced several rules on our sub throughout the election that arent enforced anywhere else, [remember this](https://imgur.com/a/zlDK9#jvPcJ6w) (oops admins fucked up the code on /all) These are just a few examples that come to the top of my head..............\\n\\n> and then publicly talked about it and it\\'s still the biggest war crime in history to you.\\n\\nWe lost our shit because we had to deal with constant censorship and when he decided to mess with our post and edit them thats where he crossed the line so we raised a shitstorm and many redditors had our back so that was nice.\\n\\n> In another shocking twist, companies have presence on social media. I really think you guys are way too afraid of CTR. \\n\\nCTR is a propaganda machine, its not like a random company that sells a product trying to advertise on reddit. You really should inform yourself.\\n\\n> The very fact that T_D is around despite constant claims of brigading, hatred, calls for violence, mod abuse, etc are all pretty evident that DESPITE whatever politics the admins have, they are professional enough to let it keep existing as long as having it > not having it. If they\\'re all these liberal censor-happy whatevers, why not just get rid of the place?\\n\\nWe are the only Trump supporting sub on reddit, Trump did an AMA on our sub. Our sub is #2 most active sub on reddit, we have discussed this on the_donald plenty of times and come to the conclusion that reddit would turn into chaos if our sub was ever banned. The blowback would be to much so its better to keep us contained. , Don\\'t feel silly my friend. One day your stand up act will hit it big  , It makes sense why your so familiar with Type 2 and don\\'t understand Type 1.  Jerkin off with a bunch of neckbeards on World of Warcraft for \"awesome\" loot has certainly come with loads of lonely nights of pizza roll binging and Mountain Dew consumption.  Don\\'t worry though, you may have earned your diabetes but with a little diet and exercise you can get contol of your life again. , But it\\'s a meaningless slur. It has no meaning, no weight behind it. And seeing it used unironically by some people is just straight up cringy. , Lol ok mr. Cuck XD have fun living in fantasy land - and I don\\'t mean your political beliefs  , Oh I wasn\\'t necessarily trying to disagree with you, your points definitely hold true in a modern society. Just thought I might offer as to where monogamy might have originated, and it\\'s place in society today. \\n\\nAs for the other bit,\\n\\n>\"you are special to me, you are the only one I want to have sex with\". Alright but you just defined a sex based relationship.\\n\\nI don\\'t know that it does though, other intimate activities such as cheek-kissing, cuddling or hugging or even some gift-giving to a third party (none of which must be sexual) can cause jealousy in monogamous relationships, as though the closeness with a secondary person diminishes the closeness with the primary. And it common enough for someone in a monogamous relationship to feel this way about a partners actions that there may indeed be something to that logic, especially if both primary parties initially agreed to be monogamous.\\n\\nEdit: Just caught your intentional misquote! Nice! , I think you\\'re attributing that incorrectly. You\\'ve reduced it to something is not. Two people in a monogamous relationship may see them linked but the desire to keep physical intimacy between the two doesn\\'t mean it\\'s \"sex based\". That seems super dismissive of 99% of all human relationships. , I\\'d argue that open-relationships are more \"sex-based\" because you don\\'t care enough about your partner to dedicate all of your time and energy on them, and instead waste it fucking random people. See, I can do it too. It\\'s amazing the fucking drivel people post on reddit. , Ikr? I\\'m pretty confident in both my relationship and sex life. I guess the fact that they\\'re so paranoid about their \"totally real\" internet wives cheating on them makes them the betas, doesn\\'t it? , If one comment from some random guy on reddit makes you \"unhappy\" then maybe you should develop a drug habit and go away. , I hope you get home safe to your safe space! :) , Bro I\\'m asking you what you want me to cite. We agreed on the definition of a socialist state, and you seem to agree the government is in control of the economy. I have no idea what fact you\\'re trying to dispute. , I don\\'t think you understand irony and parody , [deleted] , I think you\\'re going to see just how much liberal\\'s thoughts matter in the coming years, considering Donald Trump lost the popular vote and shouldn\\'t even be President. , They saw a problem with it and gave every single user a way to filter what they saw.\\n\\n*You have the tools to not be upset but you\\'re still upset.*\\n\\n>before it was \"small percentage of die-hards\" and now \"just users reacting\", well OK.\\n\\nWell... yeah. T_D has 360k subbed users. That\\'s not even *active* users and is still a TINY fraction of people who use reddit. Not everyone who participates in T_D is subbed, but I\\'d be willing to bet the VAAAAAAAAST majority of people that do participate are indeed subbed. Active users in the place? No clue. I don\\'t think that\\'s possible to figure out.\\n\\nBut there *are* lots of young T_D accounts that seem to post just mainly T_D stuff.\\n\\nThey are a \"coordinated\" tiny group of users that all upvote the same things.\\n\\nThey really are just a small group of die-hards.\\n\\n\"Users Reacting\" is just the other people of reddit. They see something they like, they upvote. They dislike it, they downvote. I would assume lots of the diehard anti-trump people also typically tend to upvote and downvote in unison.\\n\\nRecently there have been plenty of decisions made by the Trump administration that have been widely seen as mistakes. Even other countries are decrying them. His approval rating was an all-time low for an incoming president and has dropped at a HISTORIC rate since then. \\n\\nIt\\'s no surprise people are voicing their opinions against the guy more and more, and as a result, more and more anti-trump communities are getting popular. , Trump has record disapproval rates so it\\'s going pretty well you insecure facist cuck. You guys should keep sneaking out of your circlejerk actually. Some of you will eventually fuck up and get your safe space banned like the alt right sub you kiddos loved so much. I wonder what sort of drug addiction you have that made you vote for Trump? Or are you just a red state cretin?  , 23k up votes, majority disapproval of Trump his first week in office, lost popular vote by 3 million, 2 nationwide protests his first week in office. But no one cares huh? Get outta here with your garbage opinion.

I don\\'t understand why you\\'re surprised at what I said. If people bot and the admins find out, they get banned, no matter what side they\\'re on. That\\'s how it should be.\\n\\n> i refer you back to the admin/mod chat leak where there is virtually no support for Trump or our subs right to free speech. \\n\\nThey\\'re not required to be on trump\\'s side. They\\'re not required to have a certain amount of admins pro-Trump.\\n\\nAnd remember: you don\\'t have a right to free speech on reddit. Whether it be on the site as a whole or in each sub.\\n\\nOr any privately-owned website, for that matter.\\n\\n>The only place on reddit where i dont have to listen to a liberal whine\\n\\nShrug. If people disagree with you, you\\'re gonna hear about it. Internet, baby.\\n\\n>Wow you think thats all he did, he changed the algorithm several times to prevent us from reaching /all, constantly threatened our sub of getting banned (extremely stressful during election)\\n\\nThey changed the algorithm because the users of reddit were complaining that they were seeing one sub spamming content. I hate to break it to you, but reddit as a whole definitely leans liberal. Heck, most people don\\'t want to see ANY sub constantly filling up their front page. The algorithm affects everyone.\\n\\nThey\\'re constantly toying with the idea of banning the sub because they do things that are ban-worthy. This is not surprising. But for now, keeping it around > not keeping it around. You guys are worth more than if they were to ban the sub.\\n\\nThe behavior on both sides got worse as the election went on.\\n\\nDon\\'t do things that are against the rules and you won\\'t get banned?\\n\\n> reddit admins even enforced several rules on our sub throughout the election that arent enforced anywhere else\\n\\nExamples? I could also point out that this has been true for T_D for as long as T_D has existed and their mods even have to make public announcements occasionally reminding their users not to do those things. Brigading, hate speech, racism, etc.\\n\\n>remember this (oops admins fucked up the code on /all) \\n\\nYeah I remember that code error that lasted a small amount of time.\\n\\n>CTR is a propaganda machine\\n\\nAs is Breitbart, as is CNN, as it reddit, as is everything.

T_D\\'s very own sidebar lists a few, including /r/WomenForTrump.

Keep riding Trumps dick like the bad hombre you are. Now you are trying to take what I said about you, and you\\'re diabetes, and turn it around? ROFL. Nice one - what are you fucking six?\\n\\nBy the way - your is the possessive, you should have used you\\'re, but then again I can\\'t expect a fourth grade education from Trumpets now can I.  , I guess that we will have to agree to disagree in that case. I don\\'t see any problem with it. , sub 90 iq idiot , It is, and it\\'s a common attitude in the poly community. It makes it just a little harder to be tolerant and accepting of them for me. , You just said the desire to keep sex between the two of them doesn\\'t make it sex based. I\\'m not trying to troll, but i need more explanation, as that \\'the desire to keep physical intimacy between only them\\' sounds like a relationship based on sex. , I don\\'t agree with that is my (very obvious) point.  I\\'m done responding because you\\'re either retarded or trolling me. , I don\\'t think you understand that parody involves more than exact imitation. And you know what they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery ;)\\n\\nAnd I don\\'t know what you *think* irony means, but it means something else. Irony would be something more like this:\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE-uhXKO-nk\\n\\nEdit: linked the wrong version <3 , Why would people jump ship? Everyone groups Trump and his supporters into one basket, so they think criticisms are shills, especially since they don\\'t see what he does as a fuck up. Even worse is your suggestion that people should jump ship just because of anti-Trump sentiment. These people joined r/the_donald because of those reasons probably in the first place. \\n\\nThere definitely is inorganic activity, but the sub is so active that shit gets flushed out by Pepe\\'s or stupid portrait-posting. Not that people would know, since the point of the shilling would be to blend in and push whatever you are paid to push, on either side. But like I said, ShareBlue exists and continues to operate. \\n\\nLike I said in my original post, the huge spikes of td happens when something validates the views of the sub, such as, say, an admin editing user posts, or msm is caught in a lie. \\n\\nAll in all, I just want open conversation. Glad I wasn\\'t preemptively banned like I was in /enoughtrumpspam. , lol oh is that how our elections work? I didn\\'t know they changed  , > They are a \"coordinated\" tiny group of users that all upvote the same things.\\n> \"Users Reacting\" is just the other people of reddit. They see something they like, they upvote. They dislike it, they downvote. \\n\\nWell he was elected so I suppose he doesn\\'t have \"tiny group of die-hards\", he is supposed to have people supporting his agenta and people against him (as he won with less votes), what I don\\'t like is nerfing of votes for one side. Nerf both (what I\\'d prefer) or don\\'t nerf both. , You could set up a pretty nice theater with your levels of projection. We\\'ll call it \"the Cuckoplex\" , See you\\'re not getting it. Two nationwide protests would be unprecedented and meaningful... If there weren\\'t dozens of protests over shit that didn\\'t matter by the exact same people screaming the exact same words over and over. People are sick of it. 90% of the country doesn\\'t give a shit about these protests. They aren\\'t as extreme as one side or the other. They realize that one side is not the savior or all thing social justice AND that the other side is not in fact all things Nazi. You turn people off when you act like that and you develop voter apathy at a minimum of not spite voted against you. \\n\\nSee how i mentioned a reasonable discussion is impossible? And see how you came back telling me to suck Russian and assange cock? \\n\\nGo take a look at the subreddit Ask The Donald. They actually discuss things. In fact every right leaning podcast, YouTuber, blog i have seen... They discuss things too. Watch one. Get an opposing view point for once in your life. Then go watch The Young Turks. And watch Cyenk SCREAM over top of people then say \"were trying to have a reasonable discussion\". Watch whatever that chicks name is talk about fat shaming and how it\\'s so terrible then watch videos of her calling other people fat fucks and screaming at them on camera to get out of a place where a rally is happening. Alex Jones allows for more reasonable discussion in his interviews than these people and Alex Jones and his viewers are as nutty as they come.  , True , >Get back to me when you figure out how to use that link\\n\\n>use that link\\n\\n>link\\n\\nLol, you didn\\'t even make it a link. \\n\\nGreat discussion though. I liked the part where you got BTFO and had nothing to say in response. , Regular facts like Donald Trump is a racist? , wow what a cuck do you have to disagree with everything i say? Im done arguing lol, wasting my time.\\n , Maybe in fantasy land! Come back to the real world, bud  , Seems sort of like kink shaming, honestly. , Just because it\\'s a part of it, didn\\'t make it the basis. You\\'re saying that they only love each other because they want to fuck, I\\'m saying that because they love each other, they want to fuck only each other. , You don\\'t agree with WHAT? Oh my god it\\'s like I\\'m talking to a wall. Do you not agree with the definition of socialism? With the fact that Nazi Germany\\'s government had complete control of production and industry?\\n\\nChrist.\\n\\nGo ahead, run. I swear to god it\\'s like you guys try to be ignorant. , Literally the second definition: http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ironic\\nHaha you guys try so hard , [deleted] , He was elected because the Electoral college elected him, because the right always votes, and because he barely won several key states.\\n\\nTrump lost the popular vote. Most people chose Hillary, but we don\\'t pick a president on that.\\n\\nI\\'m not saying everyone who voted for Trump is in the same group of die-hards. I\\'m saying T_D is a tiny group of die-hards compared to reddit and to the public as a whole. \\n\\nDo you really think the Trump voters of rural Montana as a whole have any idea what The_Donald is?\\n\\nHe HAS people supporting him and against him.\\n\\n>what I don\\'t like is nerfing of votes for one side.\\n\\nBut... the electoral college does exactly this. it nerfs the votes of big cities, which swing democrat.\\n\\nI think the idea that we should abandon the Electoral college is pretty popular right now, but it\\'s hard to actually implement. Republicans are currently relying on it (and some other things like gerrymandering and voter suppression) in order to win. If taken straight, the country as a whole is swinging more and more liberal.  , You\\'re the one coming to an anti Trump sub because you\\'re an insecure loser. You\\'re the only cuck here. Funny how cuck porn spikes in red states. , No one has to discuss anything with Trump voters. Trump won by the slimmest margins possible. The only thing that matters in 2018, 2020, and beyond are his approval numbers, which are tanking. When he becomes a political waste dump the electorate backlash happens naturally.   , [deleted] , I cannot roll my eyes hard enough at you, man.\\n\\nYou\\'re a laughable stereotype. Well done representing your side :) , ignorance is bliss, huh? , I\\'m on your side in this argument, but can we stop using those whole \"shaming\" thing? \\n\\nIt\\'s becoming the new something\"gate\". , Are you *actually* retarded? The second definition of \"ironic\" given is \"of or relating to irony or mockery.\" How does that justify your misuse? Are you trying to say irony means \"mockery?\" Because it doesn\\'t.\\n\\nhttp://www.dictionary.com/browse/irony?s=t\\n\\nNice job trying to make it look like you\\'re not retarded. Unfortunately it had the opposite effect. And *that* is irony :\\\\^) , Please provide proof of inorganic activity. Activity you disagree with, maybe. Activity thats inorganic? I don\\'t see it. Also, you just broadly generalized the entire board as ignorant, racist, children. Is there ignorance? Yes, as there is all over reddit. Are there racists? Definitely, but they are not the majority. Are there children? ¯\\\\\\\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ People on the internet can sound like they haven\\'t passed 3rd grade yet are adults, and vice versa. Just curious why I\\'m not allowed to think this way. I hope I\\'m not being rude here. , From what I see it\\'s 65mil to Clinton vs 62mil to Trump, not that big difference in a 320 million country which makes it very likely for Trump to have roughly about the same people in Reddit voting (upvoting/downvoting) for him. It was good that Reddit did take a step to reduce their spam, now they should do the same for the other side.\\n\\nI was talking about Reddit voting, not elections voting. , God forbid I use the rest of the website I\\'ve been going on for years. It\\'s a post here and now I\\'m in the comments, whoops. It\\'s at the top of all you can barely miss it. I expected ctrl-left retardery and got exactly that. It\\'s fun to see you guys squirm    , Trump won by 74 electoral votes. I wouldn\\'t call that the slimmest margins possible. You could argue that he won by 80,000 votes if those votes were distributed correctly, which ARE incredibly slim margins. But voters don\\'t tend to swing wildly from one side to another. He won a large amount of swing states that pretty up much to election night weren\\'t event considered a possibility. Remember going into election night he had like a 2% chance of winning? Then all of a sudden a few hours later he was guanateed the win if he took Michigan? And then he took Michigan? This is how polls can be so deceiving. So to that end i ask, all these approval rating polls, where were they conducted? The same places that told us he had a 2% chance of winning? Or the places that actually got him the win?\\n\\nLook i WANT Democrats to show up and vote next time. I want Republicans to show up as well. It\\'s stupid that like 30% of eligible voters are all that came out to vote. I voted trump, with some apprehension. And there are a lot of really good criticisms of him out there. But the extreme unfounded criticism that is the same language shouted over and over again isn\\'t good criticism. It numbs people to the real problems with his administration. Calling trump a homophobe? He is by FAR the most pro LGBT Republican ever. He waved a rainbow flag at a rally for the love of God. What has he actually done that makes him a homophobe? To that extent, it\\'s the same with people that are calling Milo (for all his many, many faults) a racist homophobe. (Berkely but also that woman on The View and all over the protests people shouting how he is a Nazi). The man is a gay, Jewish, Nazi. Do you see how those words might lose their power in that context?   , Thank you very much.   Let\\'s hang out sometime. , Kink shaming has been a phrase for a long time and it\\'s probably the originator of it. , We\\'re literally mocking you, you dense faggot , [deleted] , I believe he lost the popular vote by the largest margin in US history but when still winning the election.\\n\\n>not that big difference in a 320 million country \\n\\nWELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL hold on there, my friend. That\\'s a bit misleading. There aren\\'t 320 million voters. You\\'re including a LOT of people who, for one reason or another, can\\'t vote (like... children)\\n\\nThe eligible vote count for 2016 was about 231 mil. 92 mil of which didn\\'t vote.\\n\\n138 mil voted.\\n\\nThis year I believe was also one of the lowest for turnout, simply because people hated both candidates and because of a VERY negative election cycle. The problem with that is that the right tends to almost ALWAYS vote, and it\\'s the left/moderate/independant\\'s \"no I\\'m not voting\" that decided the election.\\n\\n>which makes it very likely for Trump to have roughly about the same people in Reddit voting (upvoting/downvoting) for him\\n\\nI have no idea what you\\'re trying to say with this.\\n\\n> now they should do the same for the other side.\\n\\nAgain, the \"step they took to reduce the spam\" isn\\'t directed to any side. It\\'s applicable to both. You can block any sub you want. They didn\\'t block pro-Trump subs more than anti-Trump subs. They blocked them equally. , Aww the little Nazi loser can\\'t help but come and get made fun of!  Get fucked, all 63 million of you idiots, drug addicts, and red state cretins. You\\'re a cancer on this country  , > Trump won by 74 electoral votes. I wouldn\\'t call that the slimmest margins possible.\\n\\nAnd by 70-80k votes in an election with over 100 million voters. \\n\\n>But voters don\\'t tend to swing wildly from one side to another.\\n\\nYes they do. Every political cycle. People in power (Obama, Trump) get all the blame along with their party then voters tired of that party vote them out.\\n\\n>He won a large amount of swing states that pretty up much to election night weren\\'t event considered a possibility. \\n\\nBy very thin margins.\\n\\n>Remember going into election night he had like a 2% chance of winning?\\n\\nAccording to some models, that doesn\\'t disprove anything about politics at large or the fact he was an outlier.\\n\\n>Look i WANT Democrats to show up and vote next time.\\n\\nThen Trump is the best thing you could hope for. There won\\'t be a Hillary ticket driving down votes in 2020 nor will there be apathy of having just had 8 years under Obama.\\n\\n>I voted trump, with some apprehension.\\n \\nYou voted for a man who doesn\\'t know what he\\'s doing. He\\'s not even reading the laws he signs.\\n\\n> But the extreme unfounded criticism that is the same language shouted over and over again isn\\'t good criticism.\\n\\nToo bad, when he ran on dividing the country with his rhetoric the only natural course was a public backlash. Extremism begets more extremism. \\n\\n>He is by FAR the most pro LGBT Republican ever. He waved a rainbow flag at a rally for the love of God. \\n\\nWaving a flag doesn\\'t make you anything. His daughter had to talk him out of an anti LGBT executive order. He wants to appoint people to the supreme court who will shit on their rights. He wants Christian rule and in effect discrimination of any non Christians becomes more mainstream.\\n\\n\\n>To that extent, it\\'s the same with people that are calling Milo (for all his many, many faults) a racist homophobe.\\n\\nMile IS a racist homophobe. Or at least that\\'s what he pretends to be. Have you read his earlier work? He was \"sjw\" as some altrighters like to call it before gamergate and it wasn\\'t until he saw he could make a profit off alt righters that his rhetoric magically changed. He\\'s a professional troll feeding off right wing reactionaries. He defends the alt right, he deseves his Nazi tag. At a certain point even forced racism as red meat to your followers is just racism.\\n\\n>The man is a gay, Jewish, Nazi. Do you see how those words might lose their power in that context?\\n\\nHe\\'s catholic, and a self hating gay (the right\\'s favorite kind.) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n , *That\\'s not what irony means.*\\n\\nJesus.\\n\\nChrist. , Well, alright. Hope to* have a nice day/night.\\n\\nEdit: I meant you not to , > I have no idea what you\\'re trying to say with this\\n\\nI\\'m trying to say that with roughly the same votes, as a mainly US visited site, Reddit is expected to have people supporting and hating trump at the same rate, with a lean on hating trump.\\n\\n> the \"step they took to reduce the spam\" isn\\'t directed to any side. It\\'s applicable to both. You can block any sub you want.\\n\\nI\\'m talking about the nerf to the r/all page for pro-trump votes, not the filtering from paid to free. It\\'s now harder to do for against-trump votes because of multiple subreddits that pop up but it\\'s their problem to solve.\\n , You\\'re doing a great job at it too. Keep on pissing your pants for ~~four~~ eight years, we\\'ll keep winning. Also get some variety in there, holy shit. Learn some German words or something to really get those Nazi digs in.     , I can\\'t format this correctly on mobile but your first and their points i literally mentioned in my comment. I don\\'t agree with the second. Areas as a whole tend to swing but most voters stick by their party. \\n\\nYou cherry picked my comment about Democrats showing up. I didn\\'t say I want them to win I just want this country to fucking vote. I do think trump will make Democrats show up more next time around but i also think the \"peaceful demonstrations\" are going to hurt the cause more than how Trump is portrayed and make more Republicans actually vote too. \\n\\nYou mentioned that it was ONE model that showed him being an outlier. I would argue him being an outlier is WHY he won. But that 2% model was the model that was blasted everywhere. If you watched any election coverage you would think they asked every single American who they were going to vote for and unequivocally 98% said Hillary.  It doesn\\'t matter if maybe one poll out there got it right, that poll didn\\'t get traction. Which was my point. Polls don\\'t matter. They didn\\'t then and they don\\'t now with his approval ratings. Polls are too easily skewed to fit a story line. \\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know enough about Milo\\'s history to comment on your points. I\\'ve never really followed him all i know is he is probably racist and definitely way too far right but I also know he\\'s gay. Hence why I think the Nazi and homophobe name calling is unfounded. With that being said, I am fairly certain that prior to the protesting and Twitter ban the vast majority of America is as ignorant on Milo as I am. Maybe he is a self loathing gay i don\\'t know. From what I\\'ve seen of him I have not seen anything that supports that, but again i dont pay a lot of attention to him. , Read the 7th line on the link *you posted*\\n\\nYou \\n\\nFucking \\n\\nIdiot , >I\\'m trying to say that with roughly the same votes, as a mainly US visited site, Reddit is expected to have people supporting and hating trump at the same rate, with a lean on hating trump.\\n\\nReddit is VERY much not representative of the country or even of the voting population.\\n\\nExample: shitloads of old people vote but are typically not computer-savvy enough to jump on reddit.\\n\\nThere are many other such groups that aren\\'t going to be proportionally-represented on this site for whatever reason.\\n\\n>I\\'m talking about the nerf to the r/all page for pro-trump votes\\n\\nWhile the reddit algorithm is secret, I don\\'t believe it it was for specifically pro-Trump votes towards T_D. It wasn\\'t directed at that sub specifically. It was a blanket change that affected ALL subs.\\n\\nIt was a response to users complaining about content spam. , Hahaha that\\'s just the insecure cretin motto right there. \"Calling us what we are is winning!\" Said the Trump cuck whose president has majority disapproval in the first week of his term. Your country hates your president and all you can do is pretend it\\'s a good thing!  What red state are you from little meth head? , Most voters don\\'t matter. It\\'s people in the middle.\\n\\nIf all dems voted Republicans wouldn\\'t win in the first place.\\n\\n>i also think the \"peaceful demonstrations\" are going to hurt the cause more than how Trump is portrayed and make more Republicans actually vote too.\\n\\nDoubtful. What\\'s going to hurt your talking point is pretending nationwide protests are mostly violent. Nice right wing propaganda. Even if more republicans voted if Dems have higher turnout it won\\'t matter.\\n\\nHe won because Americans are stupid and they voted for a man that represents their stupidity. He has nothing to offer.\\n\\nMost polls did in fact show the correct outcome, just not on a state by state basis. It was some media outlets that made predictions based on the polls that led them to being wrong. Again, he won by less than a 1% in some swing states. When it\\'s that close the polls will rarely show an exact outcome because of the way polls work. It\\'s not that the polls were wrong, it\\'s that you don\\'t understand them. People did the same shit after Brexit, \"the polls showed it\\'d never happen!\" when it was a even split almost the entire lead up to the vote.  Bashing polls is another failed right wing propaganda talking point. He\\'s the first president in decades to tank in approvals the first week. Ignoring that just makes you look out of touch.\\n\\nYou can be gay and sellout other gays. He\\'s not self loathing he\\'s a sociopath predator who will say anything to push his relevance. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n , You\\'re not doing *that* either. Do you seriously equate mimicking memetic insults with *literary irony?* Those are not even remotely the same thing. There\\'s no clash between words and actions. You\\'re parroting contextless phrases. Be honest, have you ever even read a book?\\n\\nI swear to god you guys will twist yourselves into the most convoluted fucking knots trying to make yourselves out to be clever. , Winning as in, we\\'ve already accomplished shit we\\'re setting out to do, two weeks in. You still haven\\'t stopped shitting your pants since Nov 8th. Keep calling middle America Nazis. You know best after all, you pick the best candidates and sure know how to win those elections.\\n\\nWe\\'re done here, I\\'m tired of arguing on the internet. It\\'s retarded , I didn\\'t say *literary irony* at all, just irony. We are *mocking* you guys which falls under \\n\\n\\n> 7. an objectively sardonic style of speech or writing.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll save sometime:\\n\\n> Sardonic: adjective\\n1.\\ncharacterized by bitter or scornful derision; mocking; cynical; sneering:\\n\\nDo you not understand words have meanings beyond their technical definitions and gather meanings over time?? Are *you* literally retarded?? You\\'re the one who is bending over backwards trying to prove I\\'m wrong haha. Stop trying to use a strawman argument to win. , America hates what you\\'re doing. There will be a backlash and no amount of pretending there won\\'t will save your dumbass president or your idiotic political views. Don\\'t you have a French race to go ruin comrade ? Your president is a joke and so are you. You don\\'t represent middle America you represent apathy and drug addicts. Trump will galvanise the American public.  , *WHAT* STRAWMAN??\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nTrying to convince you to stop misusing one word is bad enough. I\\'m not going another level deeper with you.\\n\\nIt\\'s fine. Words can mean whatever you want sweetie. You don\\'t have to worry about definitions. You\\'re special.\\n\\nI\\'m going now, why don\\'t you just have a nice conspicuous time here on planet nonsense while I exfoliate my way over to the triad to galvanize my kestrel. , [deleted] , Lol k. I said irony, you tried to limit it to literary irony(something I never said). If you can\\'t read definitions off the links *you posted*, that\\'s not my problem. Have fun with your fallacies. , It\\'s 2017 and you still complain about SJWs unironically. Your entire life is rustled.  , [deleted] , Oh, you know my timezone? Isn\\'t that a lovely assumption. I guess it\\'s actually YOU that\\'s whining at 7 am because it\\'s definitely not even close to 7 am here. Nice projection.  , [deleted] , There\\'s nothing wrong with voicing my political opinion as early as I want.  , [deleted] , You mean like our president? I see nothing wrong here. , [deleted] , I\\'m sorry being anti PC offends you , [deleted] , And yet here you are after hours of complaining about some of the tone in my argument.  , [deleted] , This is why you\\'re out of touch with America.  , [deleted] , I don\\'t care who you voted for. Nice try though.  , [deleted] , This is your battle. You picked it. You can leave it.  , [deleted] , You haven\\'t had a point in like 5 posts. You\\'ve been rambling all day. I don\\'t know what you think you\\'re doing but it\\'s not arguing.  , [deleted] , nah I\\'m just seeing how many posts about nothing you can make'"
